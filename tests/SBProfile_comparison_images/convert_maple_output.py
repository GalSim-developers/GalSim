This program converts the outputs of a Maple program (which cannot write directly to 
a fits file) into images that can be used for the SBProfile tests.
The Maple program is saved in the same directory as moffat_pixel.mw.
And the output that it produces is saved as moffat_pixel.dat.
This program converts that into a fits file called moffat_pixel.fits.
