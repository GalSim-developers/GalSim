GalSim: The modular galaxy image simulation toolkit
===================================================

GalSim is open-source software for simulating images of astronomical objects
(stars, galaxies) in a variety of ways.  The bulk of the calculations are
carried out in C++, and the user interface is in python.  In addition, the code
can operate directly on "config" files, for those users who prefer not to work
in python.  The impetus for the software package was a weak lensing community
data challenge, called GREAT3:

    http://great3challenge.info/

However, the code has numerous additional capabilities beyond those needed for
the challenge, and has been useful for a number of projects that needed to
simulate high-fidelity galaxy images with accurate sizes and shears.  At the
end of this file, there is a list of the code capabilities and plans for future
development.  For details of algorithms and code validation, please see

    http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26C....10..121R


Installation
------------

Normally, to install GalSim, you should just need to run

    pip install galsim

Depending on your setup, you may need to add either sudo to the start
or --user to the end of this command as you normally do when pip installing
packages.

See INSTALL.md for full details including one dependency (FFTW) that is not
pip installable, so you may need to install before running this command.

You can also use conda via conda-forge

    conda install -c conda-forge galsim

How to communicate with the GalSim developers
---------------------------------------------

Currently, the lead developers for GalSim are:

  - Mike Jarvis (mikejarvis17 at gmail)
  - Rachel Mandelbaum (rmandelb at andrew dot cmu dot edu)
  - Josh Meyers (jmeyers314 at gmail)

However, many others have contributed to GalSim over the years as well, for
which we are very grateful.

If you have a question about how to use GalSim, a good place to ask it is at
[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).  Some of the GalSim developers
have alerts set up to be automatically notified about questions with the
'galsim' tag, so there is a good chance that your question will be answered.

If you have any trouble installing or using the code, or find a bug, or have a
suggestion for a new feature, please open up an Issue on our [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim/issues).  We also accept
pull requests if you have something you'd like to contribute to the code base.

If none of these communication avenues seem appropriate, you can also contact
us directly at the above email addresses.


Getting started
---------------

* Install the code as above (see also INSTALL.md).

* Optional, but recommended whenever you try a new version of the code: run the
  unit tests to make sure that there are no errors.  You can do this by running
  `python setup.py test`.  If there are any issues, please open an Issue on our
  GitHub page.

* Optional: run `doxygen` to generate documentation, using `Doxyfile` in the
  main repository directory to specify all doxygen settings.  Alternatively,
  you can view the documentation online at

      http://galsim-developers.github.io/GalSim/


Reference documentation
-----------------------

For an overview of GalSim workflow and python tools, please see the file
`doc/GalSim_Quick_Reference.pdf` in the GalSim repository.  A guide to using
the configuration files to generate simulations, a FAQ for installation issues,
and other useful references can be found on the GalSim wiki,

    https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim/wiki

More thorough documentation for all parts of the code can be found in the
doxygen documentation mentioned in the previous section, or in the python
docstrings in `galsim/*.py`.


Repository directory structure
------------------------------

The repository has a number of subdirectories. Below is a guide to their
contents:

* bin/ :      executables (after the compilation procedure is done).
* devel/ :    an assortment of developer tools.
* doc/ :      documentation, including a `Quick Reference` guide and, if the
              user generates doxygen documentation using Doxyfile, the outputs
              will also go in this directory.
* examples/ : example scripts (see the following section).
* galsim/ :   the python code for GalSim (which is what most end-users interact
              with).
* include/ :  the .h header files for the C++ parts of GalSim.
* lib/ :      compiled libraries (after the compilation procedure is done).
* pysrc/ :    the code that makes the purely C++ parts of GalSim accessible to
              the python layer of GalSim.
* src/ :      the source code for the purely C++ parts of GalSim.
* tests/ :    unit tests.


Demonstration scripts
---------------------

There are a number of scripts in `examples/` that demonstrate how the code can
be used.  These are called `demo1.py`...`demo13.py`.  You can run them by
typing (e.g.) `python demo1.py` while sitting in `examples/`, All demo scripts
are designed to be run in the `examples/` directory.  Some of them access
files in subdirectories of the `examples/` directory, so they would not work
correctly from other locations.

A completely parallel sequence of configuration files, called `demo1.yaml`...
`demo11.yaml`, demonstrates how to make the same set of simulations using
config files that are parsed by the executable `bin/galsim`.  (There are no
corresponding .yaml files for demo12 and demo13 yet, because some of the
functionality cannot yet be carried out using config files.)

Two other scripts in the `examples/` directory that may be of interest, but
are not part of the GalSim tutorial series, are `make_coadd.py`, which
demonstrates the use of the FourierSqrt transformation to optimally coadd
images, and `psf_wf_movie.py`, which demonstrates the realistic atmospheric
PSF code by making a movie of a time-variable PSF and wavefront.

As the project develops through further versions, and adds further
capabilities to the software, more demo scripts may be added to `examples/`
to illustrate what GalSim can do.


Tagged versions
---------------

Each GalSim release is tagged in git with the tag name `vX.X.X`.  You can see
the available tags using the command

    git tag -l

at a terminal from within the repository.  In addition to the official
releases, we also have tags for various other milestones that were important
at one time or another.

The version of the code at any given snapshot can be downloaded from our
GitHub webpage, or checked out from the repository using the tag name, e.g.:

    git checkout v2.1.2

This will then update your directory tree to the snapshot of the code at the
milestone requested.  (You will also get a message about being in a "detached"
HEAD state.  That is normal.)

For a version history and a description of how the current version of the code
differs from the last tagged version, see HISTORY.md and CHANGELOG.md
(respectively).  These files are found in the main GalSim directory, and are
also displayed on our wiki which is linked above.


Summary of current capabilities
-------------------------------

Currently, GalSim has the following capabilities:

* Can generate PSFs from a variety of simple parametric models such as Moffat,
  Kolmogorov, and Airy, as well as an optical PSF model that includes Zernike
  aberrations to arbitrary order, and an optional central obscuration and
  struts.

* Can simulate galaxies from a variety of simple parametric models as well as
  from real HST data.  For information about downloading a suite of COSMOS
  images, see

      https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim/wiki/RealGalaxy%20Data

* Can simulate atmospheric PSFs from realistic turbulent phase screens.

* Can make the images either via i) Fourier transform, ii) real-space
  convolution (real-space being occasionally faster than Fourier), or
  iii) photon-shooting.  The exception is that objects that include a
  deconvolution (such as RealGalaxy objects) must be carried out using Fourier
  methods only.

* Can handle wavelength-dependent profiles and integrate over filter
  bandpasses appropriately.

* Can apply shear, magnification, dilation, or rotation to a galaxy profile
  including lensing-based models from a power spectrum or NFW halo profile.

* Can draw galaxy images into arbitrary locations within a larger image.

* Can add noise using a variety of noise models, including correlated noise.

* Can whiten or apply N-fold symmetry to existing correlated noise that is
  already in an image.

* Can read in input values from a catalog, a dictionary file (such as a JSON
  or YAML file), or a fits header.

* Can write images in a variety of formats: regular FITS files, FITS data
  cubes, or multi-extension FITS files.  It can also compress the output files
  using various compressions including gzip, bzip2, and rice.

* Can carry out nearly any simulation that a user might want using two parallel
  methods: directly using python code, or by specifying the simulation
  properties in an input configuration script.  See the demo scripts in
  the examples/ directory for examples of each.

* Supports a variety of possible WCS options from a simple pixel scale factor
  of arcsec/pixel to affine transforms to arbitrary functions of (x,y),
  including a variety of common FITS WCS specifications.

* Can include a range of simple detector effects such as nonlinearity,
  brighter-fatter effect, etc.

* Has a module that is particularly meant to simulate images for the WFIRST
  survey.


Summary of planned future development
-------------------------------------

We plan to add the following additional capabilities in future versions of
GalSim:

* Wavelength-dependent photon shooting.  Currently, the chromatic functionality
  is only available for FFT rendering, which is quite slow.  For most use
  cases, photon shooting should be orders of magnitude faster, so this is
  a near-term priority to get done.  (cf. Issue #540)

* Simulating more sophisticated detector defects and image artifacts.  E.g.
  vignetting, fringing, cosmic rays, saturation, bleeding, ... (cf. Issues
  #553, #828)

* Proper modeling of extinction due to dust. (cf. Issues #541, #550)

* Various speed improvements.  (cf. Issues #205, #566, #875, #935)

* Switch docs to Sphinx. (cf. Issue #160)

There are many others as well.  Please see

    https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim/issues

for a list of the current open issues.  And feel free to add an issue if there
is something useful that you think should be possible, but is not currently
implemented.
