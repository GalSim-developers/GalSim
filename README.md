# GalSim: The modular galaxy image simulation toolkit

For installation instructions, please see the file `INSTALL.md` in the main
repository directory. 

There are tagged versions of the code corresponding to specific project 
releases and development milestones.  

If interested in code from before `v0.1`, the tagged milestone versions may be 
the best ones to try if you want a stable version with specific capabilities.  

(For more info on tags see the "Milestone tags" Section below and 
`docs/git.txt`)


How to get started
------------------

1. We assume that all steps in `INSTALL.md` are complete.

2. Optional, but recommended whenever you try a new version of the code: run the
unit tests to make sure that there are no errors.  You can do this by running
`scons tests`.

3. Optional: run `doxygen` to generate documentation, using `Doxyfile` in the
main repository directory to specify all doxygen settings.  You can 
alternatively view the documentation on GitHub at 
http://galsim-developers.github.com/GalSim/


Demonstration scripts
---------------------

Once these steps are completed, there are a number of scripts in `examples/` 
that demonstrate how the code can be used.  These labelled `demo1.py`-`demo8.py`

As the project develops through further versions, and adds further
capabilities to the software, further demo scripts will be added to `examples/`
to illustrate and showcase what GalSim can do.


Reference documentation
-----------------------

For an overview of GalSim workflow and tools, please see 
`doc/GalSim_Quick_Reference.pdf` in the GalSim repository.

For the Python GSObject classes used to describe astronomical objects, see 
galsim.base in the doxygen documentation.


Additional scripts
------------------

While the demo scripts can be run from the command-line while sitting in
`examples/` without any arguments, the remaining scripts are auxiliary utilities
that take various command-line arguments, which are always explained in comments
at the top of the file.

* `ShootInterpolated.py` is a script that takes as input a filename for a FITS
image, which it will simulate (optionally sheared and/or resampled) via
photon-shooting.

* `MeasMoments.py` can be used to measure the adaptive moments (best-fit
elliptical Gaussian) for a FITS image.

* `MeasShape.py` can be used to carry out PSF correction using one of four
methods, given FITS images of the galaxy and PSF.


Release and Milestone tags
--------------------------

After every GalSim release and development milestone we tag a snapshot of the 
code at that moment, with the tag name `vX.X` or `milestoneN` where N is the 
milestone number.

You can see the available tags using the command

    git tag -l

at terminal from within the repository.

The version of the code at any given snapshot can then be checked out using the
tag name, e.g.:

    $ git checkout milestone2

This will then update your directory tree to the snapshot of the code at the 
milestone requested.  (You will also get a message about being in a "detached" 
HEAD state.  That is normal.)
