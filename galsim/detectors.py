def applyNonlinearity(self, NLfunc, *args):
    """
    Applies the given non-linearity function (`NLfunc`) on the Image instance directly.

    This routine can transform the image in a non-linear manner specified by the user. However,
    the typical kind of non-linearity one sees in astronomical images is voltage non-linearity,
    also sometimes known as 'classical non-linearity', refers to the non-linearity in
    charge-to-voltage conversion process. This arises as charge gets integrated at the junction
    capacitance of the pixel node. Voltage non-linearity decreases signals at higher signal
    levels, causing the attenuation of brighter pixels. The image should include both the
    signal from the astronomical objects as well as the background level. Other detectors effects
    such as dark current and persistence (not currently included in GalSim) would also occur
    before the inclusion of nonlinearity.

    The argument `NLfunc` is a callable function (for example a lambda function, a
    galsim.LookupTable, or a user-defined function), possibly with arguments that need to be given
    as subsequent arguments to the `applyNonlinearity` function (after the `NLfunc` argument).
    `NLfunc` should be able to take a 2d NumPy array as input, and return a NumPy array of the same
    shape.  It should be defined such that it outputs the final image with nonlinearity included
    (i.e., in the limit that there is no nonlinearity, the function should return the original
    image, NOT zero). The image should be in units of electrons when this routine is being used
    to generate classical non-linearity. When used for other purposes, the units can be in
    electrons or in ADU, as found appropriate by the user.

    Calling with no parameter:
    -------------------------

        >>> f = lambda x: x + (1.e-7)*(x**2)
        >>> img.applyNonlinearity(f)

    Calling with 1 or more parameters:
    ---------------------------------

        >>> f = lambda x, beta1, beta2: x - beta1*x*x + beta2*x*x*x
        >>> img.applyNonlinearity(f, 1.e-7, 1.e-10)

    On calling the method, the Image instance `img` is transformed by the user-defined function `f`
    with `beta1` = 1.e-7 and `beta2` = 1.e-10.

    @param NLfunc    The function that maps the input image pixel values to the output image pixel
                     values.
    @param *args     Any subsequent arguments are passed along to the NLfunc function.

def addReciprocityFailure(self, exp_time, alpha, base_flux):
    """
    Accounts for the reciprocity failure and includes it in the original Image directly.

    Reciprocity, in the context of photography, is the inverse relationship between the incident
    flux (I) of a source object and the exposure time (t) required to produce a given response (p)
    in the detector, i.e., p = I*t. At very low (also at high) levels of incident flux, deviation
    from this relation is observed, leading to reduced sensitivity at low flux levels. The pixel
    response to a high flux is larger than its response to a low flux. This flux-dependent non-
    linearity is known as 'Reciprocity Failure' and is known to happen in photographic films since
    1893. Interested users can refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(photography)

    CCDs are not known to suffer from this effect. HgCdTe detectors that are used for near infrared
    astrometry, although to an extent much lesser than the photographic films, are found to
    exhibit reciprocity failure at low flux levels. The exact mechanism of this effect is unknown
    and hence we lack a good theoretical model. Many models that fit the empirical data exist and
    a common relation is

            pR/p = (1 + alpha*log10(p/t) - alpha*log10(p'/t'))

    where t is the exposure time (in units of seconds), p is the pixel response (in units of
    electrons) and pR is the response if the reciprocity relation fails to hold. p'/t' is count
    rate (in electrons/second) corresponding to the photon flux (base flux) at which the detector
    is calibrated to have its nominal gain. alpha is the parameter in the model, measured in units
    of per decade and varies with detectors and the operating temperature. The functional form for
    the reciprocity failure is motivated empirically from the tests carried out on H2RG detectors.
    See for reference Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 of http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1090. Since pR/p remains
    close to unity over a wide range of flux, we convert this relation to a power law by
    approximating (pR/p)-1 ~ log(pR/p). This gives a relation that is better behaved than the
    logarithmic relation at low flux levels.

            pR/p = ((p/t)/(p'/t'))^(alpha/log(10)).

    Because of how this function is defined, the input image must have non-negative pixel
    values for the resulting image to be well-defined. Negative pixel values result in 'nan's.
    The image should be in units of electrons, or if it is in ADU, then the value passed to
    exp_time should be the exposure time divided by the nominal gain. The image should include
    both the signal from the astronomical objects as well as the background level.  The addition of
    nonlinearity should occur after including the effect of reciprocity failure.

def applyIPC(self, IPC_kernel, edge_treatment='extend', fill_value=None, kernel_nonnegativity=True,
    kernel_normalization=True):
    """
    Applies the effect of interpixel capacitance to the Image instance.

    In NIR detectors, the quantity that is sensed is not the charge as in CCDs, but a voltage that
    relates to the charge present within each pixel. The voltage read at a given pixel location is
    influenced by the charges present in the neighboring pixel locations due to capacitive
    coupling of sense nodes.

    This interpixel capacitance is approximated as a linear effect that can be described by a 3x3
    kernel that is convolved with the image. The kernel must be an Image instance and could be
    intrinsically anisotropic. A sensible kernel must have non-negative entries and must be
    normalized such that the sum of the elements is 1, in order to conserve the total charge.
    The (1,1) element of the kernel is the contribution to the voltage read at a pixel from the
    electrons in the pixel to its bottom-left, the (1,2) element of the kernel is the contribution
    from the charges to its left and so on.

    The argument 'edge_treatment' specifies how the edges of the image should be treated, which
    could be in one of the three ways:

    1. 'extend': The kernel is convolved with the zero-padded image, leading to a larger
        intermediate image. The central portion of this image is returned.  [default]
    2. 'crop': The kernel is convolved with the image, with the kernel inside the image completely.
        Pixels at the edges, where the center of the kernel could not be placed, are set to the
        value specified by 'fill_value'. If 'fill_value' is not specified or set to 'None', then
        the pixel values in the original image are retained. The user can make the edges invalid
        by setting fill_value to numpy.nan.
    3. 'wrap': The kernel is convolved with the image, assuming periodic boundary conditions.

    The size of the image array remains unchanged in all three cases.

def applyPersistence(self,imgs,coeffs):
    """
    Applies the effects of persistence to the Image instance.

    Persistence refers to the retention of a small fraction of the signal after resetting the
    imager pixel elements. The persistence signal of a previous exposure is left in the pixel even
    after several detector resets. This effect is most likely due to charge traps in the material.
    Laboratory tests on the WFIRST CMOS detectors show that if exposures and readouts are taken in
    a fixed cadence, the persistence signal can be given as a linear combination of prior pixel
    values that can be added to the current image.

    This routine takes in a list of Image instances and adds them to Image weighted by the values
    passed on to 'coeffs'. The pixel values of the Image instances in the list must correspond to
    the electron counts before the readout. This routine does NOT keep track of realistic dither
    patterns. During the image simulation process, the user has to queue a list of previous Image
    instances (imgs) outside the routine by inserting the latest image in the beginning of the list
    and deleting the oldest image. The values in 'coeffs' tell how much of each Image is to be
    added. This usually remains constant in the image generation process.

    Rounds the pixel values in an image to integer values, while preserving the type of the data.

    At certain stages in the astronomical image generation process, detectors effectively round to
    the nearest integer.  The exact stage at which this happens depends on the type of device (CCD
    vs. NIR detector).  For example, for H2RG detectors, quantization happens in two stages: first,
    when detecting a certain number of photons, corresponding to the sum of background and signal
    multiplied by the QE and including reciprocity failure.  After this, a number of other processes
    occur (e.g., nonlinearity, IPC, read noise) that could result in non-integer pixel values, only
    rounding to an integer at the stage of analog-to-digital conversion.
