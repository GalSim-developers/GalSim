"""@file fds_test.py
I found these routines helpful in tracking down some errors about too many files being open.
I've fixed the errors, but I'll leave this module here in case it is useful for someone else
down the road.  I lifted the code from the following StackOverflow answers:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4814970/subprocess-check-output-doesnt-seem-to-exist-python-2-6-5

To use it do the following:

    >>> import galsim.fds_test as fds
    >>> ...
    >>> try:
    >>>     [... Code that might raise OSError ...]
    >>> except OSError as e:
    >>>     print 'Caught ',e
    >>>     fds.printOpenFiles()
    >>>     raise

Of course, you can also do fds.printOpenFiles() elsewhere too for information.

You can also keep track of the number of open files and pipes with:

    >>> print 'files, pipes = ',fds.openFiles()
