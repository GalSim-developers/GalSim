Functions for dealing with galsim.RealGalaxy objects and the catalogs that store their data.

The galsim.RealGalaxy uses images of galaxies from real astrophysical data (e.g. the Hubble Space
Telescope), along with a PSF model of the optical properties of the telescope that took these
images, to simulate new galaxy images with a different (must be larger) telescope PSF.  A 
description of the simulation method can be found in Section 5 of Mandelbaum et al. (2012; MNRAS, 
540, 1518), although note that the details of the implementation in Section 7 of that work are not 
relevant to the more recent software used here.

This module defines the RealGalaxyCatalog class, used to store all required information about a
real galaxy simulation training sample and accompanying PSF model.  For information about 
downloading GalSim-readable RealGalaxyCatalog data in FITS format, see the RealGalaxy Data Download
page on the GalSim Wiki: 
https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim/wiki/RealGalaxy%20Data%20Download%20Page

The function simReal takes this information and uses it to simulate a (no-noise-added) image from 
some lower-resolution telescope.

class RealGalaxy(GSObject):
    """A class describing real galaxies from some training dataset.  It's underlying implementation
    uses Convolve instance of an InterpolatedImage (for the observed galaxy) with a Deconvolve
    of another InterpolatedImage (for the PSF).

    This class uses a catalog describing galaxies in some training data (for more details, see the
    RealGalaxyCatalog documentation) to read in data about realistic galaxies that can be used for
    simulations based on those galaxies.  Also included in the class is additional information that
    might be needed to make or interpret the simulations, e.g., the noise properties of the training
    data.

    The GSObject drawShoot method is unavailable for RealGalaxy instances.

    Initialization
    --------------
    
        real_galaxy = galsim.RealGalaxy(real_galaxy_catalog, index=None, id=None, random=False, 
                                        rng=None, x_interpolant=None, k_interpolant=None,
                                        flux=None, pad_factor = 0, noise_pad=False, pad_image=None,
                                        use_cache = True)

    This initializes real_galaxy with three InterpolatedImage objects (one for the deconvolved
    galaxy, and saved versions of the original HST image and PSF). Note that there are multiple
    keywords for choosing a galaxy; exactly one must be set.  In future we may add more such
    options, e.g., to choose at random but accounting for the non-constant weight factors
    (probabilities for objects to make it into the training sample).  

    Note that preliminary tests suggest that for optimal balance between accuracy and speed,
    `k_interpolant` and `pad_factor` should be kept at their default values.  The user should be
    aware that significant inaccuracy can result from using other combinations of these parameters;
    see devel/modules/finterp.pdf, especially table 1, in the GalSim repository.

    @param real_galaxy_catalog  A RealGalaxyCatalog object with basic information about where to
                                find the data, etc.
    @param index                Index of the desired galaxy in the catalog.
    @param id                   Object ID for the desired galaxy in the catalog.
    @param random               If true, then just select a completely random galaxy from the
                                catalog.
    @param rng                  A random number generator to use for selecting a random galaxy 
                                (may be any kind of BaseDeviate or None) and to use in generating
                                any noise field when padding.  This user-input random number
                                generator takes precedence over any stored within a user-input
                                CorrelatedNoise instance (see `noise_pad` param below).
    @param x_interpolant        Either an Interpolant2d (or Interpolant) instance or a string 
                                indicating which real-space interpolant should be used.  Options 
                                are 'nearest', 'sinc', 'linear', 'cubic', 'quintic', or 'lanczosN' 
                                where N should be the integer order to use. [default 
                                `x_interpolant = galsim.Lanczos(5,...)'].
    @param k_interpolant        Either an Interpolant2d (or Interpolant) instance or a string 
                                indicating which k-space interpolant should be used.  Options are 
                                'nearest', 'sinc', 'linear', 'cubic', 'quintic', or 'lanczosN' 
                                where N should be the integer order to use.  We strongly recommend
                                leaving this parameter at its default value; see text above for
                                details.  [default `k_interpolant = galsim.Quintic()'].
    @param flux                 Total flux, if None then original flux in galaxy is adopted without
                                change [default `flux = None`].
    @param pad_factor           Factor by which to pad the Image when creating the
                                InterpolatedImage; `pad_factor <= 0` results in the use of the
                                default value, 4.  We strongly recommend leaving this parameter at
                                its default value; see text above for details.
                                [Default `pad_factor = 0`.]
    @param noise_pad            Pad the Interpolated image with zeros, or with noise of a level 
                                specified in the training dataset?  There are several options here: 
                                    Use `noise_pad = False` if you wish to pad with zeros.
                                    Use `noise_pad = True` if you wish to pad with uncorrelated
                                        noise of the proper variance.
                                    Set `noise_pad` equal to a galsim.CorrelatedNoise, an Image, or
                                        a filename containing an Image of an example noise field
                                        that will be used to calculate the noise power spectrum and
                                        generate noise in the padding region.  Any random number
                                        generator passed to the `rng` keyword will take precedence
                                        over that carried in an input galsim.CorrelatedNoise.
                                In the last case, if the same file is used repeatedly, then use of
                                the `use_cache` keyword (see below) can be used to prevent the need
                                for repeated galsim.CorrelatedNoise initializations.
                                [default `noise_pad = False`]
    @param pad_image            Image to be used for deterministically padding the original image.
                                This can be specified in two ways:
                                   (a) as a galsim.Image; or
                                   (b) as a string which is interpreted as a filename containing an
                                       image to use.
                                The size of the image that is passed in is taken to specify the
                                amount of padding, and so the `pad_factor` keyword should be equal
                                to 1, i.e., no padding.  The `pad_image` scale is ignored, and taken
                                to be equal to that of the `image`. Note that `pad_image` can be
                                used together with `noise_pad`.  However, the user should be careful
                                to ensure that the image used for padding has roughly zero mean.
                                The purpose of this keyword is to allow for a more flexible
                                representation of some noise field around an object; if the user
                                wishes to represent the sky level around an object, they should do
                                that when they have drawn the final image instead.  (Default
                                `pad_image = None`.)
    @param use_cache            Specify whether to cache noise_pad read in from a file to save
                                having to build an CorrelatedNoise repeatedly from the same image.
                                (Default `use_cache = True`)
    @param gsparams             You may also specify a gsparams argument.  See the docstring for
                                galsim.GSParams using help(galsim.GSParams) for more information
                                about this option.

class RealGalaxyCatalog(object):
    """Class containing a catalog with information about real galaxy training data.

    The RealGalaxyCatalog class reads in and stores information about a specific training sample of
    realistic galaxies. We assume that all files containing the images (galaxies and PSFs) live in
    one directory; they could be individual files, or multiple HDUs of the same file.  Currently
    there is no functionality that lets this be a FITS data cube, because we assume that the object
    postage stamps will in general need to be different sizes depending on the galaxy size.  

    If only the catalog name (`'real_galaxy_catalog.fits'`) is specified, then the set of galaxy/PSF
    image files (e.g., `'real_galaxy_images_1.fits'`, `'real_galaxy_PSF_images_1.fits'`, etc.) are
    assumed to be in the directory as the catalog file (in the following example, in the current 
    working directory `./`):

        >>> my_rgc = galsim.RealGalaxyCatalog('real_galaxy_catalog.fits')

    If `image_dir` is specified, the set of galaxy/PSF image files is assumed to be in the
    subdirectory of where the catalog is (in the following example, `./images`):

        >>> my_rgc = galsim.RealGalaxyCatalog('real_galaxy_catalog.fits', image_dir='images')

    If the real galaxy catalog is in some far-flung directory, and the galaxy/PSF image files are in 
    its subdirectory, one only needs to specify the long directory name once:

        >>> file_name = '/data3/scratch/user_name/galsim/real_galaxy_data/real_galaxy_catalog.fits'
        >>> image_dir = 'images'
        >>> my_rgc = galsim.RealGalaxyCatalog(file_name, image_dir=image_dir)

    In the above case, the galaxy/PSF image files are in the directory 
    `/data3/scratch/user_name/galsim/real_galaxy_data/images/`.

    The above behavior is changed if the `image_dir` specifies a directory.  In this case, 
    `image_dir` is interpreted as the full path:

        >>> file_name = '/data3/scratch/user_name/galsim/real_galaxy_data/real_galaxy_catalog.fits'
        >>> image_dir = '/data3/scratch/user_name/galsim/real_galaxy_data/images'
        >>> my_rgc = galsim.RealGalaxyCatalog(file_name, image_dir=image_dir)

    When `dir` is specified without `image_dir` being specified, both the catalog and
    the set of galaxy/PSF images will be searched for under the directory `dir`:

        >>> catalog_dir = '/data3/scratch/user_name/galsim/real_galaxy_data'
        >>> file_name = 'real_galaxy_catalog.fits'
        >>> my_rgc = galsim.RealGalaxyCatalog(file_name, dir=catalog_dir)

    If the `image_dir` is specified in addition to `dir`, the catalog name is specified as 
    `dir/file_name`, while the galaxy/PSF image files will be searched for under `dir/image_dir`:

        >>> catalog_dir = '/data3/scratch/user_name/galsim/real_galaxy_data'
        >>> file_name = 'real_galaxy_catalog.fits'
        >>> image_dir = 'images'
        >>> my_rgc = galsim.RealGalaxyCatalog(file_name, image_dir=image_dir, dir=catalog_dir)

    To explore for the future: scaling with number of galaxies, adding more information as needed,
    and other i/o related issues.

    The GalSim repository currently contains an example catalog, in
    `GalSim/examples/data/real_galaxy_catalog_example.fits` (100 galaxies), along with the
    corresponding image data in other files (`real_galaxy_images.fits` and
    `real_galaxy_PSF_images.fits`) in that directory.  For information on how to download a larger

    This function takes a RealGalaxy from some training set, and manipulates it as needed to 
    simulate a (no-noise-added) image from some lower-resolution telescope.  It thus requires a
    target PSF (which could be an image, or one of our base classes) that represents all PSF 
    components including the pixel response, and a target pixel scale.  

    The default rotation option is to impose a random rotation to make irrelevant any real shears 
    in the galaxy training data (optionally, the RNG can be supplied).  This default can be turned 
    off by setting `rand_rotate = False` or by requesting a specific rotation angle using the
    `rotation_angle` keyword, in which case `rand_rotate` is ignored.

    Optionally, the user can specify a shear (default 0).  Finally, they can specify a flux 
    normalization for the final image, default 1000.

    @param real_galaxy         The RealGalaxy object to use, not modified in generating the
                               simulated image.
    @param target_PSF          The target PSF, either one of our base classes or an ImageView/Image.
    @param target_pixel_scale  The pixel scale for the final image, in arcsec.
    @param g1                  First component of shear to impose (components defined with respect
                               to pixel coordinates), default `g1 = 0.`
    @param g2                  Second component of shear to impose, default `g2 = 0.`
    @param rotation_angle      Angle by which to rotate the galaxy (must be a galsim.Angle 
                               instance).
    @param rand_rotate         If `rand_rotate = True` (default) then impose a random rotation on 
                               the training galaxy; this is ignored if `rotation_angle` is set.
    @param rng                 A random number generator to use for selection of the random 
                               rotation angle. (optional, may be any kind of galsim.BaseDeviate 
                               or None)
    @param target_flux         The target flux in the output galaxy image, default 
                               `target_flux = 1000.`
    @param image               As with the GSObject.draw() function, if an image is provided,
                               then it will be used and returned.
                               If `image=None`, then an appropriately sized image will be created.
