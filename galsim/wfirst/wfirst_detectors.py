Accounts for the reciprocity failure for the WFIRST directors and includes it in the original

argument.

Parameters:

    exptime:        The exposure time (t) in seconds, which goes into the expression for
                    reciprocity failure given in the docstring.  If None, then the routine

This method applies either of the two different persistence models: 'linear' and 'fermi'.
Slew between pointings and consecutive resets after illumination are not considered.

'linear' persistence model
    Applies the persistence effect to the Image instance by adding a small fraction of the
    previous exposures (up to {ncoeff}) supplied as the 'prev_exposures' argument.
    For more information about persistence, see `galsim.Image.applyPersistence`.
    Unlike that routine, this one does not need the coefficients to be specified. However,
    the list of previous {ncoeff} exposures will have to be supplied. Earlier exposures, if
    supplied, will be ignored.

'fermi' persistence model
    Applies the persistence effect to the Image instance by adding the accumulated persistence
    dark current of previous exposures supplied as the 'prev_exposures' argument.
    Unlike galsim.Image.applyPersistence, this one does not use constant coefficients but a
    fermi model plus a linear tail below half of saturation.

    For more info about the fermi model, see:

    http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/ins_performance/persistence/

Parameters:
    img:                The Image to be transformed.
    prev_exposures:     List of Image instances in the order of exposures, with the recent
                        exposure being the first element. In the linear model, the exposures
                        exceeding the limit ({ncoeff} exposures) will be ignored.

allDetectorEffects.__doc__ = """
This utility applies all sources of noise and detector effects for WFIRST that are implemented
in GalSim.  In terms of noise, this includes the Poisson noise due to the signal (sky +
background), dark current, and read noise.  The detector effects that are included are
reciprocity failure, quantization, persistence, nonlinearity, and interpixel capacitance. It
also includes the necessary factors of gain.  In short, the user should be able to pass in an
Image with all sources of signal (background plus astronomical objects), and the Image will be
modified to include all subsequent steps in the image generation process for WFIRST that are
implemented in GalSim. However, to include the effect of persistence, the user needs to provide
a list of recent exposures (without the readout effects) and the routine
returns an updated list of recent exposures.

Parameters:
    img:            The Image to be modified.
    prev_exposures: List of Image instances in the order of exposures, with
                    the recent exposure being the first element. [default: ()]
    rng:            An optional galsim.BaseDeviate to use for the addition of noise.  If
                    None, a new one will be initialized.  [default: None]
    exptime:        The exposure time, in seconds.  If None, then the WFIRST default
                    exposure time will be used.  [default: {exptime}]
