Definitions for the GalSim base classes and associated methods

This file includes the key parts of the user interface to GalSim: base classes representing surface
brightness profiles for astronomical objects (galaxies, PSFs, pixel response).  These base classes
are collectively known as GSObjects.  They include both simple objects like the galsim.Gaussian, a 
2d Gaussian intensity profile, and compound objects like the galsim.Add and galsim.Convolve, which 
represent the sum and convolution of multiple GSObjects, respectively. 

These classes also have associated methods to (a) retrieve information (like the flux, half-light 
radius, or intensity at a particular point); (b) carry out common operations, like shearing, 
rescaling of flux or size, rotating, and shifting; and (c) actually make images of the surface 
brightness profiles.

For a description of units conventions for scale radii for our base classes, see
doc/GalSim_Quick_Reference.pdf section 2.2.  In short, any system that will ensure consistency
between the scale radii used to specify the size of the GSObject and between the pixel scale of the
Image is acceptable.

        The draw method is used to draw an Image of the GSObject, typically using Fourier space
        convolution (or, for certain GSObjects that have hard edges, real-space convolution may be
        used), and using interpolation to carry out image transformations such as shearing.  This
        method can create a new Image or can draw into an existing one, depending on the choice of
        the `image` keyword parameter.  Other keywords of particular relevance for users are those
        that set the pixel scale for the image (`dx`), that choose the normalization convention for
        the flux (`normalization`), and that decide whether the clear the input Image before drawing
        into it (`add_to_image`).

        Note that when drawing a GSObject that was defined with a particular value of flux, it is
        not necessarily the case that a drawn image with 'normalization=flux' will have the sum of
        pixel values equal to flux.  That condition is guaranteed to be satisfied only if the
        profile has been convolved with a pixel response. If there was no convolution by a pixel
        response, then the draw method is effectively sampling the surface brightness profile of the
        GSObject at pixel centers without integrating over the flux within pixels, so for profiles
        that are poorly sampled and/or varying rapidly (e.g., high n Sersic profiles), the sum of
        pixel values might differ significantly from the GSObject flux.

        On return, the image will have a member `added_flux`, which will be set to be the total
        flux added to the image.  This may be useful as a sanity check that you have provided a 
        large enough image to catch most of the flux.  For example:
        
            obj.draw(image)
            assert image.added_flux > 0.99 * obj.getFlux()

        The appropriate threshold will depend on your particular application, including what kind
        of profile the object has, how big your image is relative to the size of your object, etc.

        @param image  If provided, this will be the image on which to draw the profile.

                        appropriately based on the profile's size (default `image = None`).

                      If `dx` is `None` and `image != None`, then take the provided image's pixel 
                        scale.
                      If `dx` is `None` and `image == None`, then use the Nyquist scale 
                        `= pi/maxK()`.

        @param wmult  A factor by which to make an automatically-sized image larger than it would 
                      normally be made.  This factor also applies to any intermediate images during

                      automatically chosen to reach some preset accuracy targets (see 
                      include/galsim/SBProfile.h); however, if you see strange artifacts in the 
                      image, you might try using `wmult > 1`.  This will take longer of 
                      course, but it will produce more accurate images, since they will have 
                      less "folding" in Fourier space. (Default `wmult = 1.`)

        @param normalization  Two options for the normalization:
                              "flux" or "f" means that the sum of the output pixels is normalized
                                  to be equal to the total flux.  (Modulo any flux that falls off 
                                  the edge of the image of course, and note the caveat in the draw
                                  method documentation regarding the need to convolve with a pixel
                                  response.)
                              "surface brightness" or "sb" means that the output pixels sample
                                  the surface brightness distribution at each location.
                              (Default `normalization = "flux"`)

        @param add_to_image  Whether to add flux to the existing image rather than clear out
                             anything in the image before drawing.
                             Note: This requires that image be provided (i.e. `image` is not `None`)
                             and that it have defined bounds (default `add_to_image = False`).

        """Draw an image of the object by shooting individual photons drawn from the surface 
        brightness profile of the object.

        The drawShoot() method is used to draw an image of an object by shooting a number of photons
        to randomly sample the profile of the object. The resulting image will thus have Poisson
        noise due to the finite number of photons shot.  drawShoot() can create a new Image or use
        an existing one, depending on the choice of the `image` keyword parameter.  Other keywords
        of particular relevance for users are those that set the pixel scale for the image (`dx`),
        that choose the normalization convention for the flux (`normalization`), and that decide
        whether the clear the input Image before shooting photons into it (`add_to_image`).

        It is important to remember that the image produced by drawShoot() represents the object as
        convolved with the square image pixel.  So when using drawShoot() instead of draw(), you
        should not explicitly include the pixel response by convolving with a Pixel GSObject.  Using
        drawShoot without convolving with a Pixel will produce the equivalent image (for very large
        n_photons) as draw() produces when the same object is convolved with `Pixel(xw=dx)` when
        drawing onto an image with pixel scale `dx`.

        Note that the drawShoot method is unavailable for objects which contain an SBDeconvolve,
        or are compound objects (e.g. Add, Convolve) that include an SBDeconvolve.

        On return, the image will have a member `added_flux`, which will be set to be the total
        flux of photons that landed inside the image bounds.  This may be useful as a sanity check 
        that you have provided a large enough image to catch most of the flux.  For example:
        
            obj.drawShoot(image)
            assert image.added_flux > 0.99 * obj.getFlux()

        The appropriate threshold will depend on your particular application, including what kind
        of profile the object has, how big your image is relative to the size of your object, 
        whether you are keeping `poisson_flux = True`, etc.

        @param image  If provided, this will be the image on which to draw the profile.
                      If `image = None`, then an automatically-sized image will be created.
                      If `image != None`, but its bounds are undefined (e.g. if it was constructed 
                        with `image = galsim.ImageF()`), then it will be resized appropriately base 
                        on the profile's size.

                                   the surface brightness distribution at each location.

                                Note: This requires that image be provided (i.e. `image != None`)
                                and that it have defined bounds (default `add_to_image = False`).
                              
        @param n_photons        If provided, the number of photons to use.
                                If not provided (i.e. `n_photons = 0`), use as many photons as
                                  necessary to result in an image with the correct Poisson shot 
                                  noise for the object's flux.  For positive definite profiles, this
                                  is equivalent to `n_photons = flux`.  However, some profiles need
                                  more than this because some of the shot photons are negative 
                                  (usually due to interpolants).
                                (Default `n_photons = 0`).

        @param rng              If provided, a random number generator to use for photon shooting.
                                  (may be any kind of `galsim.BaseDeviate` object)
                                If `rng=None`, one will be automatically created, using the time
                                  as a seed.
                                (Default `rng = None`)

        @param max_extra_noise  If provided, the allowed extra noise in each pixel.
                                  This is only relevant if `n_photons=0`, so the number of photons 
                                  is being automatically calculated.  In that case, if the image 
                                  noise is dominated by the sky background, you can get away with 
                                  using fewer shot photons than the full `n_photons = flux`.
                                  Essentially each shot photon can have a `flux > 1`, which 
                                  increases the noise in each pixel.  The `max_extra_noise` 
                                  parameter specifies how much extra noise per pixel is allowed 
                                  because of this approximation.  A typical value for this might be
                                  `max_extra_noise = sky_level / 100` where `sky_level` is the flux
                                  per pixel due to the sky.  If the natural number of photons 
                                  produces less noise than this value for all pixels, we lower the 
                                  number of photons to bring the resultant noise up to this value.
                                  If the natural value produces more noise than this, we accept it 
                                  and just use the natural value.  Note that this uses a "variance"
                                  definition of noise, not a "sigma" definition.
                                (Default `max_extra_noise = 0.`)

        @param poisson_flux     Whether to allow total object flux scaling to vary according to 
                                Poisson statistics for `n_photons` samples (default 
                                `poisson_flux = True` unless n_photons is given, in which case
                                the default is `poisson_flux = False`).

    @param lam_over_diam   lambda / telescope diameter in the physical units adopted for dx 
                           (user responsible for consistency).
    @param defocus         Defocus in units of incident light wavelength.

                           wavelength.
    @param astig2          Second component of astigmatism (like e2) in units of incident light
                           wavelength.
    @param coma1           Coma along x in units of incident light wavelength.
    @param coma2           Coma along y in units of incident light wavelength.
    @param spher           Spherical aberration in units of incident light wavelength.
    @param circular_pupil  Adopt a circular pupil? Alternative is square.
    @param obscuration     Linear dimension of central obscuration as fraction of pupil linear 
                           dimension, [0., 1.) [default `obscuration = 0.`].
    @param interpolant     Either an Interpolant2d (or Interpolant) instance or a string indicating
                           which interpolant should be used.  Options are 'nearest', 'sinc', 
                           'linear', 'cubic', 'quintic', or 'lanczosN' where N should be the 
                           integer order to use. [default `interpolant = galsim.Quintic()`]
    @param oversampling    Optional oversampling factor for the SBInterpolatedImage table 
                           [default `oversampling = 1.5`], setting oversampling < 1 will produce 
                           aliasing in the PSF (not good).
    @param pad_factor      Additional multiple by which to zero-pad the PSF image to avoid folding
                           compared to what would be employed for a simple galsim.Airy 
                           [default `pad_factor = 1.5`].  Note that `pad_factor` may need to be 
                           increased for stronger aberrations, i.e. those larger than order unity.
    @param flux            Total flux of the profile [default `flux=1.`].

class InterpolatedImage(GSObject):
    """A class describing non-parametric objects specified using an Image, which can be interpolated
    for the purpose of carrying out transformations.

    The input Image and optional interpolants are used to create an SBInterpolatedImage.  The
    InterpolatedImage class is useful if you have a non-parametric description of an object as an
    Image, that you wish to manipulate / transform using GSObject methods such as applyShear(),
    applyMagnification(), applyShift(), etc.  The input Image can be any BaseImage (i.e., Image,
    ImageView, or ConstImageView).

    The constructor needs to know how the Image was drawn: is it an Image of flux or of surface
    brightness?  Since our default for drawing Images using draw() and drawShoot() is that
    `normalization == 'flux'` (i.e., sum of pixel values equals the object flux), the default for 
    the InterpolatedImage class is to assume the same flux normalization.  However, the user can 
    specify 'surface brightness' normalization if desired, or alternatively, can instead specify 
    the desired flux for the object.

    If the input Image has a scale associated with it, then there is no need to specify an input
    scale `dx`.

    The user may optionally specify an interpolant, `x_interpolant`, for real-space manipulations
    (e.g., shearing, resampling).  If none is specified, then by default, a 5th order Lanczos
    interpolant is used.  The user may also choose to specify two quantities that can affect the
    Fourier space convolution: the k-space interpolant (`k_interpolant`) and the amount of padding
    to include around the original images (`pad_factor`).  The default values for `x_interpolant`,
    `k_interpolant`, and `pad_factor` were chosen based on preliminary tests suggesting that they
    lead to a high degree of accuracy without being excessively slow.  Users should be particularly
    wary about changing `k_interpolant` and `pad_factor` from the defaults without careful testing.
    The user is given complete freedom to choose interpolants and pad factors, and no warnings are
    raised when the code is modified to choose some combination that is known to give significant
    error.  More details can be found in devel/modules/finterp.pdf, especially table 1, in the
    GalSim repository.

    The user can choose to have the image padding use zero (default), Gaussian random noise of some
    variance, or a Gaussian but correlated noise field that is specified either as an ImageCorrFunc,
    an Image (from which a noise correlation function is derived), or a string (interpreted as a
    filename containing an image to use for deriving the noise correlation function).  The user can
    also pass in a random number generator to be used for noise generation.  Finally, the user can
    pass in a `pad_image` for deterministic image padding.

    By default, the InterpolatedImage recalculates the Fourier-space step and number of points to
    use for further manipulations, rather than using the most conservative possibility.  For typical
    objects representing galaxies and PSFs this can easily make the difference between several
    seconds (conservative) and 0.04s (recalculated).  However, the user can turn off this option,
    and may especially wish to do so when using images that do not contain a high S/N object - e.g.,
    images of noise fields.

        >>> interpolated_image = galsim.InterpolatedImage(image, x_interpolant = None,
                                                          k_interpolant = None,

                                                          flux = None, pad_factor = 0.,
                                                          noise_pad = 0., rng = None,
                                                          pad_image = None,
                                                          calculate_stepk = True,
                                                          calculate_maxk = True,
                                                          use_cache = True)

    Initializes interpolated_image as a galsim.InterpolatedImage() instance.

    For comparison of the case of padding with noise or zero when the image itself includes noise,
    compare `im1` and `im2` from the following code snippet (which can be executed from the
    examples/ directory):

        image = galsim.fits.read('data/147246.0_150.416558_1.998697_masknoise.fits')
        int_im1 = galsim.InterpolatedImage(image)
        int_im2 = galsim.InterpolatedImage(image, noise_pad='../tests/blankimg.fits')
        im1 = galsim.ImageF(1000,1000)
        im2 = galsim.ImageF(1000,1000)
        int_im1.draw(im1)
        int_im2.draw(im2)

    Examination of these two images clearly shows how padding with a correlated noise field that is
    similar to the one in the real data leads to a more reasonable appearance for the result when
    re-drawn at a different size.

    @param image           The Image from which to construct the object.
                           This may be either an Image (or ImageView) instance or a string
                           indicating a fits file from which to read the image.
    @param x_interpolant   Either an Interpolant2d (or Interpolant) instance or a string indicating
                           which real-space interpolant should be used.  Options are 'nearest',
                           'sinc', 'linear', 'cubic', 'quintic', or 'lanczosN' where N should be the
                           integer order to use. (Default `x_interpolant = galsim.Quintic()`)
    @param k_interpolant   Either an Interpolant2d (or Interpolant) instance or a string indicating
                           which k-space interpolant should be used.  Options are 'nearest', 'sinc',
                           'linear', 'cubic', 'quintic', or 'lanczosN' where N should be the integer
                           order to use.  We strongly recommend leaving this parameter at its
                           default value; see text above for details.  (Default `k_interpolant =
                           galsim.Quintic()`)
    @param normalization   Two options for specifying the normalization of the input Image:
                              "flux" or "f" means that the sum of the pixels is normalized
                                  to be equal to the total flux.
                              "surface brightness" or "sb" means that the pixels sample
                                  the surface brightness distribution at each location.
                              (Default `normalization = "flux"`)
    @param dx              If provided, use this as the pixel scale for the Image; this will
                           override the pixel scale stored by the provided Image, in any.  If `dx`
                           is `None`, then take the provided image's pixel scale.
                           (Default `dx = None`.)
    @param flux            Optionally specify a total flux for the object, which overrides the
                           implied flux normalization from the Image itself.
    @param pad_factor      Factor by which to pad the Image when creating the SBInterpolatedImage;
                           `pad_factor <= 0` results in the use of the default value, 4.  We
                           strongly recommend leaving this parameter at its default value; see text
                           above for details.
                           (Default `pad_factor = 0`, unless a `pad_image` is passed in, which
                           results in a default value of `pad_factor = 1`.)
    @param noise_pad       Noise properties to use when padding the original image with
                           noise.  This can be specified in several ways:
                               (a) as a float, which is interpreted as being a variance to use when
                                   padding with uncorrelated Gaussian noise; 
                               (b) as a galsim.ImageCorrFunc, which contains information about the
                                   desired noise power spectrum; 
                               (c) as a galsim.Image of a noise field, which is used to calculate
                                   the desired noise power spectrum; or
                               (d) as a string which is interpreted as a filename containing an
                                   example noise field with the proper noise power spectrum.
                           It is important to keep in mind that the calculation of a
                           galsim.ImageCorrFunc is a non-negligible amount of overhead, so the
                           recommended ways are (b) or (d). In the case of (d), if the same file is
                           used repeatedly, then use of the `use_cache` keyword (see below) can be
                           used to prevent the need for repeated galsim.ImageCorrFunc
                           initializations.
                           (Default `noise_pad = 0.`, i.e., pad with zeros.)
    @param rng             If padding by noise, the user can optionally supply the random noise
                           generator to use for drawing random numbers as `rng` (may be any kind of
                           `galsim.BaseDeviate` object).
                           If `rng=None`, one will be automatically created, using the time as a
                           seed. (Default `rng = None`)
    @param pad_image       Image to be used for deterministically padding the original image.  This
                           can be specified in two ways:
                               (a) as a galsim.Image; or
                               (b) as a string which is interpreted as a filename containing an
                                   image to use.
                           The size of the image that is passed in is taken to specify the amount of
                           padding, and so the `pad_factor` keyword should be equal to 1, i.e., no
                           padding.  The `pad_image` scale is ignored, and taken to be equal to that
                           of the `image`. Note that `pad_image` can be used together with
                           `noise_pad`.  However, the user should be careful to ensure that the
                           image used for padding has roughly zero mean.  The purpose of this
                           keyword is to allow for a more flexible representation of some noise
                           field around an object; if the user wishes to represent the sky level
                           around an object, they should do that when they have drawn the final
                           image instead.  (Default `pad_image = None`.)
    @param calculate_stepk Specify whether to perform an internal determination of the extent of 
                           the object being represented by the InterpolatedImage; often this is 
                           useful in choosing an optimal value for the stepsize in the Fourier 
                           space lookup table. (Default `calculate_stepk = True`)
    @param calculate_maxk  Specify whether to perform an internal determination of the highest 
                           spatial frequency needed to accurately render the object being 
                           represented by the InterpolatedImage; often this is useful in choosing 
                           an optimal value for the extent of the Fourier space lookup table.
                           (Default `calculate_maxk = True`)
    @param use_cache       Specify whether to cache noise_pad read in from a file to save having
                           to build an ImageCorrFunc repeatedly from the same image.
                           (Default `use_cache = True`)

    This class is typically used to represent a Pixel response function, and therefore is only

    Initialization

    A Pixel is initialized with an x dimension width `xw`, an optional y dimension width (if
    unspecifed `yw=xw` is assumed) and an optional flux parameter [default `flux = 1.`].

    Methods
    -------
    The Pixel is a GSObject, and inherits all of the GSObject methods (draw(), drawShoot(), 
    applyShear() etc.) and operator bindings.

    Note: We have not implemented drawing a sheared or rotated Pixel in real space.  It's a 
          bit tricky to get right at the edges where fractional fluxes are required.  
          Fortunately, this is almost never needed.  Pixels are almost always convolved by
          something else rather than drawn by themselves, in which case either the fourier
          space method is used, or photon shooting.  Both of these are implemented in GalSim.
          If need to draw sheared or rotated Pixels in real space, please file an issue, and
          maybe we'll implement that function.  Until then, you will get an exception if you try.

    This initializes real_galaxy with three SBInterpolatedImage objects (one for the deconvolved
    galaxy, and saved versions of the original HST image and PSF). Note that there are multiple
    keywords for choosing a galaxy; exactly one must be set.  In future we may add more such
    options, e.g., to choose at random but accounting for the non-constant weight factors
    (probabilities for objects to make it into the training sample).  Like other GSObjects, the
    RealGalaxy contains an SBProfile attribute which is an SBConvolve representing the deconvolved
    HST galaxy.

    Note that preliminary tests suggest that for optimal balance between accuracy and speed,
    `k_interpolant` and `pad_factor` should be kept at their default values.  The user should be
    aware that significant inaccuracy can result from using other combinations of these parameters;

                                catalog.
    @param rng                  A random number generator to use for selecting a random galaxy 
                                (may be any kind of BaseDeviate or None)
    @param x_interpolant        Either an Interpolant2d (or Interpolant) instance or a string 
                                indicating which real-space interpolant should be used.  Options are 
                                'nearest', 'sinc', 'linear', 'cubic', 'quintic', or 'lanczosN' 
                                where N should be the integer order to use. [default 
                                `x_interpolant = galsim.Lanczos(5,...)'].
    @param k_interpolant        Either an Interpolant2d (or Interpolant) instance or a string 
                                indicating which k-space interpolant should be used.  Options are

                                where N should be the integer order to use.  We strongly recommend
                                leaving this parameter at its default value; see text above for
                                details.  [default `k_interpolant = galsim.Quintic()'].
    @param flux                 Total flux, if None then original flux in galaxy is adopted without
                                change [default `flux = None`].
    @param pad_factor           Factor by which to pad the Image when creating the
                                SBInterpolatedImage; `pad_factor <= 0` results in the use of the
                                default value, 4.  We strongly recommend leaving this parameter at
                                its default value; see text above for details.
                                [Default `pad_factor = 0`.]
    @param noise_pad            When creating the SBProfile attribute for this GSObject, pad the
                                SBInterpolated image with zeros, or with noise of a level specified
                                in the training dataset?  There are several options here: 
                                    Use `noise_pad = False` if you wish to pad with zeros.
                                    Use `noise_pad = True` if you wish to pad with uncorrelated
                                        noise of the proper variance.
                                    Set `noise_pad` equal to a galsim.ImageCorrFunc, an Image, or a
                                        filename for a file containing an Image of an example noise
                                        field that will be used to calculate the noise power
                                        spectrum and generate noise in the padding region.
                                In the last case, if the same file is used repeatedly, then use of
                                the `use_cache` keyword (see below) can be used to prevent the need
                                for repeated galsim.ImageCorrFunc initializations.
                                [default `noise_pad = False`]
    @param pad_image            Image to be used for deterministically padding the original image.
                                This can be specified in two ways:
                                   (a) as a galsim.Image; or
                                   (b) as a string which is interpreted as a filename containing an
                                       image to use.
                               The size of the image that is passed in is taken to specify the
                                amount of padding, and so the `pad_factor` keyword should be equal
                                to 1, i.e., no padding.  The `pad_image` scale is ignored, and taken
                                to be equal to that of the `image`. Note that `pad_image` can be
                                used together with `noise_pad`.  However, the user should be careful
                                to ensure that the image used for padding has roughly zero mean.
                                The purpose of this keyword is to allow for a more flexible
                                representation of some noise field around an object; if the user
                                wishes to represent the sky level around an object, they should do
                                that when they have drawn the final image instead.  (Default
                                `pad_image = None`.)
    @param use_cache            Specify whether to cache noise_pad read in from a file to save
                                having to build an ImageCorrFunc repeatedly from the same image.
                                (Default `use_cache = True`)

    The objects to be convolved may be provided either as multiple unnamed arguments (e.g. 
    `Convolve(psf, gal, pix)`) or as a list (e.g. `Convolve([psf, gal, pix])`).  Any number of 
    objects may be provided using either syntax.  (Even 0 or 1, although that doesn't really make 
    much sense.)
   
    The convolution will normally be done using discrete Fourier transforms of each of the component
    profiles, multiplying them together, and then transforming back to real space.
   
    There is also an option to do the convolution as integrals in real space.  To do this, use the 
    optional keyword argument `real_space = True`.  Currently, the real-space integration is only 
    enabled for convolving 2 profiles.  (Aside from the trivial implementaion for 1 profile.)  If 
    you try to use it for more than 2 profiles, an exception will be raised.
    
    The real-space convolution is normally slower than the DFT convolution.  The exception is if
    both component profiles have hard edges, e.g. a truncated Moffat with a Pixel.  In that case,
    the highest frequency `maxK` for each component is quite large since the ringing dies off fairly
    slowly.  So it can be quicker to use real-space convolution instead.  Also, real-space 
    convolution tends to be more accurate in this case as well.

    If you do not specify either `real_space = True` or `False` explicitly, then we check if there 
    are 2 profiles, both of which have hard edges.  In this case, we automatically use real-space 
    convolution.  In all other cases, the default is not to use real-space convolution.

class Shapelet(GSObject):
    """A class describing polar shapelet surface brightness profiles.

    This class describes an arbitrary profile in terms of a shapelet decomposition.  A shapelet
    decomposition is an eigenfunction decomposition of a 2-d function using the eigenfunctions
    of the 2-d quantum harmonic oscillator.  The functions are Laguerre polynomials multiplied
    by a Gaussian.  See Bernstein & Jarvis, 2002 or Massey & Refregier, 2005 for more detailed 
    information about this kind of decomposition.  For this class, we follow the notation of 
    Bernstein & Jarvis.

    The decomposition is described by an overall scale length, sigma, and a vector of 
    coefficients, b.  The b vector is indexed by two values, which can be either (p,q) or (N,m).
    In terms of the quantum solution of the 2-d harmonic oscillator, p and q are the number of 
    quanta with positive and negative angular momentum (respectively).  Then, N=p+q, m=p-q.

    The 2D image is given by (in polar coordinates):

        I(r,theta) = 1/sigma^2 Sum_pq b_pq psi_pq(r/sigma, theta)

    where psi_pq are the shapelet eigenfunctions, given by:

        psi_pq(r,theta) = (-)^q/sqrt(pi) sqrt(q!/p!) r^m exp(i m theta) exp(-r^2/2) L_q^(m)(r^2)

    and L_q^(m)(x) are generalized Laguerre polynomials.
    
    The coeffients b_pq are in general complex.  However, we require that the resulting 
    I(r,theta) be purely real, which implies that b_pq = b_qp* (where * means complex conjugate).
    This further implies that b_pp (i.e. b_pq with p==q) is real. 


    Initialization
    --------------
    
    1. Make a blank Shapelet instance with all b_pq = 0.

        shapelet = galsim.Shapelet(sigma=sigma, order=order)

    2. Make a Shapelet instance using a given vector for the b_pq values.

        order = 2
        bvec = [ 1, 0, 0, 0.2, 0.3, -0.1 ]
        shapelet = galsim.Shapelet(sigma=sigma, order=order, bvec=bvec)

    We use the following order for the coeffiecients, where the subscripts are in terms of p,q.

    [ b00  Re(b10)  Im(b10)  Re(b20)  Im(b20)  b11  Re(b30)  Im(b30)  Re(b21)  Im(b21) ... ]

    i.e. we progressively increase N, and for each value of N, we start with m=N and go down to 
    m=0 or 1 as appropriate.  And since m=0 is intrinsically real, it only requires one spot
    in the list.

    @param sigma          The scale size in the standard units (usually arcsec).
    @param order          Specify the order of the shapelet decomposition.  This is the maximum
                          N=p+q included in the decomposition.
    @param bvec           The initial vector of coefficients.  (Default: all zeros)


    Methods
    -------

    The Shapelet is a GSObject, and inherits most of the GSObject methods (draw(), applyShear(),
    etc.) and operator bindings.  The exception is drawShoot, which is not yet implemented for 
    Shapelet instances.
    
    In addition, Shapelet has the following methods:

    getSigma()         Get the sigma value.
    getOrder()         Get the order, the maximum N=p+q used by the decomposition.
    getBVec()          Get the vector of coefficients, returned as a numpy array.
    getPQ(p,q)         Get b_pq.  Returned as tuple (re, im) (even if p==q).
    getNM(N,m)         Get b_Nm.  Returned as tuple (re, im) (even if m=0).

    setSigma(sigma)    Set the sigma value.
    setOrder(order)    Set the order.
    setBVec(bvec)      Set the vector of coefficients.
    setPQ(p,q,re,im=0) Set b_pq.
