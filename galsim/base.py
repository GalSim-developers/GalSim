Definitions for the GalSim base classes and associated methods

This file includes the key parts of the user interface to GalSim: base classes representing surface
brightness profiles for astronomical objects (galaxies, PSFs, pixel response).  These base classes
are collectively known as GSObjects.  They include simple objects like the Gaussian class, a 2d
Gaussian intensity profile, whereas compound GSObjects can be found in other appropriately-named
files.  For example, the Sum and Convolution, which represent the sum and convolution of multiple
GSObjects, respectively, can be found in compound.py; RealGalaxy objects are defined in real.py;
and so on.

These classes also have associated methods to (a) retrieve information (like the flux, half-light
radius, or intensity at a particular point); (b) carry out common operations, like shearing,
rescaling of flux or size, rotating, and shifting; and (c) actually make images of the surface
brightness profiles.

For a description of units conventions for scale radii for our base classes see
`doc/GalSim_Quick_Reference.pdf`, section 2.2.  In short, any system that will ensure consistency
between the scale radii used to specify the size of the GSObject and between the pixel scale of the
Image is acceptable.

class GSObject(object):
    """Base class for all GalSim classes that represent some kind of surface brightness profile.

    A GSObject is not intended to be constructed directly.  Normally, you would use whatever
    derived class is appropriate for the surface brightness profile you want:

        >>> gal = galsim.Sersic(n=4, half_light_radius=4.3)
        >>> psf = galsim.Moffat(beta=3, fwhm=2.85)
        >>> conv = galsim.Convolve([gal,psf])

    All of these classes are subclasses of GSObject, so you should see those docstrings for
    more details about how to construct the various profiles.

    Note that most GSObjects have some kind of size specification.  Typically, these would be
    given in terms of arcsec, with the connection to the pixel size being given in the Pixel
    class (0.2 arcsec/pixel in the above example).  However, you can have a more complicated
    relationship between pixel and sky coordinates.  See BaseWCS for more details about
    how to specify various kinds of world coordinate systems.

    Transforming Methods
    --------------------

    The GSObject class uses an "immutable" design[1], so all methods that would potentially modify
    the object actually return a new object instead.  This uses pointers and such behind the
    scenes, so it all happens efficiently, but it makes using the objects a bit simpler, since
    you don't need to worry about some function changing your object behind your back.

    In all cases below, we just give an example usage.  See the docstrings for the methods for
    more details about how to use them.

        >>> obj = obj.shear(shear)      # Apply a shear to the object.
        >>> obj = obj.dilate(scale)     # Apply a flux-preserving dilation.
        >>> obj = obj.magnify(mu)       # Apply a surface-brightness-preserving magnification.
        >>> obj = obj.rotate(theta)     # Apply a rotation.
        >>> obj = obj.shift(dx,dy)      # Shft the object in real space.
        >>> obj = obj.transform(dudx,dudy,dvdx,dvdy)    # Apply a general jacobian transformation.
        >>> obj = obj.lens(g1,g2,mu)    # Apply both a lensing shear and magnification.
        >>> obj = obj.withFlux(flux)    # Set a new flux value.
        >>> obj = obj * ratio           # Scale the surface brightness profile by some factor.

    Access Methods
    --------------

    There are some access methods that are available for all GSObjects.  Again, see the docstrings
    for each method for more details.

        >>> flux = obj.getFlux()
        >>> centroid = obj.centroid()
        >>> f_xy = obj.xValue(x,y)
        >>> fk_xy = obj.kValue(kx,ky)
        >>> nyq = obj.nyquistScale()
        >>> stepk = obj.stepK()
        >>> maxk = obj.maxK()
        >>> hard = obj.hasHardEdges()
        >>> axisym = obj.isAxisymmetric()
        >>> analytic = obj.isAnalyticX()

    Most subclasses have additional methods that are available for values that are particular to
    that specific surface brightness profile.  e.g. `sigma = gauss.getSigma()`.  However, note
    that class-specific methods are not available after performing one of the above transforming
    operations.

        >>> gal = galsim.Gaussian(sigma=5)
        >>> gal = gal.shear(g1=0.2, g2=0.05)
        >>> sigma = gal.getSigma()              # This will raise an exception.

    It is however possible to access the original object that was transformed via the
    `original` attribute.

        >>> sigma = gal.original.getSigma()     # This works.

    No matter how many transformations are performed, the `original` attribute will contain the
    _original_ object (not necessarily the most recent ancestor).

    Drawing Methods
    ---------------

    The main thing to do with a GSObject once you have built it is to draw it onto an image.
    There are two methods that do this.  In both cases, there are lots of optional parameters.
    See the docstrings for these methods for more details.

        >>> image = obj.drawImage(...)
        >>> kimage_r, kimage_i = obj.drawKImage(...)

    Attributes
    ----------

    There two attributes that may be available for a GSObject.

        original    This was mentioned above as a way to access the original object that has
                    been transformed by one of the transforming methods.

        noise       Some types, like RealGalaxy, set this attribute to be the intrinsic noise that
                    is already inherent in the profile and will thus be present when you draw the
                    object.  The noise is propagated correctly through the various transforming
                    methods, as well as convolutions and flux rescalings.  Note that the `noise`
                    attribute can be set directly by users even for GSObjects that do not naturally
                    have one. The typical use for this attribute is to use it to whiten the noise in
                    the image after drawing.  See CorrelatedNoise for more details.

    GSParams
    --------

    All GSObject classes take an optional `gsparams` argument, so we document that feature here.
    For all documentation about the specific derived classes, please see the docstring for each
    one individually.

    The `gsparams` argument can be used to specify various numbers that govern the tradeoff between
    accuracy and speed for the calculations made in drawing a GSObject.  The numbers are
    encapsulated in a class called GSParams, and the user should make careful choices whenever they
    opt to deviate from the defaults.  For more details about the parameters and their default
    values, please see the docstring of the GSParams class (e.g. type `help(galsim.GSParams)`).

    For example, let's say you want to do something that requires an FFT larger than 4096 x 4096
    (and you have enough memory to handle it!).  Then you can create a new GSParams object with a
    larger `maximum_fft_size` and pass that to your GSObject on construction:

        >>> gal = galsim.Sersic(n=4, half_light_radius=4.3)
        >>> psf = galsim.Moffat(beta=3, fwhm=2.85)
        >>> conv = galsim.Convolve([gal,psf])
        >>> im = galsim.Image(1000,1000, scale=0.05)        # Note the very small pixel scale!
        >>> im = conv.drawImage(image=im)                   # This uses the default GSParams.
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
          File "galsim/base.py", line 1236, in drawImage
            image.added_flux = prof.SBProfile.draw(imview.image, gain, wmult)
        RuntimeError: SB Error: fourierDraw() requires an FFT that is too large, 6144
        If you can handle the large FFT, you may update gsparams.maximum_fft_size.
        >>> big_fft_params = galsim.GSParams(maximum_fft_size=10240)
        >>> conv = galsim.Convolve([gal,psf],gsparams=big_fft_params)
        >>> im = conv.drawImage(image=im)                   # Now it works (but is slow!)
        >>> im.write('high_res_sersic.fits')

    Note that for compound objects in compound.py, like Convolution or Sum, not all GSParams can be
    changed when the compound object is created.  In the example given here, it is possible to
    change parameters related to the drawing, but not the Fourier space parameters for the
    components that go into the Convolution.  To get better sampling in Fourier space, for example,
    the `gal` and/or `psf` should be created with `gsparams` that have a non-default value of
    `folding_threshold`.  This statement applies to the threshold and accuracy parameters.

        """Draws an Image of the object.

        The drawImage() method is used to draw an Image of the current object using one of several
        possible rendering methods (see below).  It can create a new Image or can draw onto an
        existing one if provided by the `image` parameter.  If the `image` is given, you can also
        optionally add to the given Image if `add_to_image = True`, but the default is to replace
        the current contents with new values.

        Note that if you provide an `image` parameter, it is the image onto which the profile
        will be drawn.  The provided image *will be modified*.  A reference to the same image
        is also returned to provide a parallel return behavior to when `image` is `None`
        (described above).

        This option is useful in practice because you may want to construct the image first and
        then draw onto it, perhaps multiple times. For example, you might be drawing onto a
        subimage of a larger image. Or you may want to draw different components of a complex
        profile separately.  In this case, the returned value is typically ignored.  For example:

                >>> im1 = bulge.drawImage()
                >>> im2 = disk.drawImage(image=im1, add_to_image=True)
                >>> assert im1 is im2

                >>> full_image = galsim.Image(2048, 2048, scale=pixel_scale)
                >>> b = galsim.BoundsI(x-32, x+32, y-32, y+32)
                >>> stamp = obj.drawImage(image = full_image[b])
                >>> assert (stamp.array == full_image[b].array).all()

        If drawImage() will be creating the image from scratch for you, then there are several ways
        to control the size of the new image.  If the `nx` and `ny` keywords are present, then an
        image with these numbers of pixels on a side will be created.  Similarly, if the `bounds`
        keyword is present, then an image with the specified bounds will be created.  Note that it
        is an error to provide an existing Image when also specifying `nx`, `ny`, or `bounds`. In
        the absence of `nx`, `ny`, and `bounds`, drawImage will decide a good size to use based on
        the size of the object being drawn.  Basically, it will try to use an area large enough to
        include at least 99.5% of the flux.  (Note: the value 0.995 is really `1 -
        folding_threshold`.  You can change the value of `folding_threshold` for any object via
        GSParams.  See `help(GSParams)` for more details.)  You can set the pixel scale of the
        constructed image with the `scale` parameter, or set a WCS function with `wcs`.  If you do
        not provide either `scale` or `wcs`, then drawImage() will default to using the Nyquist
        scale for the current object.  You can also set the data type used in the new Image with the
        `dtype` parameter that has the same options as for the Image constructor.

        There are several different possible methods drawImage() can use for rendering the image.
        This is set by the `method` parameter.  The options are:

            'auto'      This is the default, which will normally be equivalent to 'fft'.  However,
                        if the object being rendered is simple (no convolution) and has hard edges
                        (e.g. a Box or a truncated Moffat or Sersic), then it will switch to
                        'real_space', since that is often both faster and more accurate in these
                        cases (due to ringing in Fourier space).

            'fft'       The integration of the light within each pixel is mathematically equivalent
                        to convolving by the pixel profile (a Pixel object) and sampling the result
                        at the centers of the pixels.  This method will do that convolution using
                        a discrete Fourier transform.  Furthermore, if the object (or any component
                        of it) has been transformed via shear(), dilate(), etc., then these
                        transformations are done in Fourier space as well.

            'real_space'  This uses direct integrals (using the Gauss-Kronrod-Patterson algorithm)
                        in real space for the integration over the pixel response.  It is usually
                        slower than the 'fft' method, but if the profile has hard edges that cause
                        ringing in Fourier space, it can be faster and/or more accurate.  If you
                        use 'real_space' with something that is already a Convolution, then this
                        will revert to 'fft', since the double convolution that is required to also
                        handle the pixel response is far too slow to be practical using real-space
                        integrals.

            'phot'      This uses a technique called photon shooting to render the image.
                        Essentially, the object profile is taken as a probability distribution
                        from which a finite number of photons are "shot" onto the image.  Each
                        photon's flux gets added to whichever pixel the photon hits.  This process
                        automatically accounts for the integration of the light over the pixel
                        area, since all photons that hit any part of the pixel are counted.
                        Convolutions and transformations are simple geometric processes in this
                        framework.  However, there are two caveats with this method: (1) the
                        resulting image will have Poisson noise from the finite number of photons,
                        and (2) it is not available for all object types (notably anything that
                        includes a Deconvolution).

            'no_pixel'  Instead of integrating over the pixels, this method will sample the profile
                        at the centers of the pixels and multiply by the pixel area.  If there is
                        a convolution involved, the choice of whether this will use an FFT or
                        real-space calculation is governed by the `real_space` parameter of the
                        Convolution class.  This method is the appropriate choice if you are using
                        a PSF that already includes a convolution by the pixel response.  For
                        example, if you are using a PSF from an observed image of a star, then it
                        has already been convolved by the pixel, so you would not want to do so
                        again.  Note: The multiplication by the pixel area gets the flux
                        normalization right for the above use case.  cf. `method = 'sb'`.

            'sb'        This is a lot like 'no_pixel', except that the image values will simply be
                        the sampled object profile's surface brightness, not multiplied by the
                        pixel area.  This does not correspond to any real observing scenario, but
                        it could be useful if you want to view the surface brightness profile of an
                        object directly, without including the pixel integration.

        Normally, the flux of the object should be equal to the sum of all the pixel values in the
        image, less some small amount of flux that may fall off the edge of the image (assuming you
        don't use `method='sb'`).  However, you may optionally set a `gain` value, which converts
        between photons and ADU (so-called analog-to-digital units), the units of the pixel values
        in real images.  Normally, the gain of a CCD is in electrons/ADU, but in GalSim, we fold
        the quantum efficiency into the gain as well, so the units are photons/ADU.  The flux of
        the object is then taken to be in photons, and the `gain` converts this to ADU.

        The 'phot' method has a few extra parameters that adjust how it functions.  The total
        number of photons to shoot is normally calculated from the object's flux.  This flux is
        taken to be given in photons, so for most simple profiles, this will equal the number of
        photons shot.  (See the discussion in Rowe et al, 2014, for why this might be modified for
        InterpolatedImage and related profiles.)  However, you can manually set a different number
        of photons with `n_photons`.  You can also set `max_extra_noise` to tell drawImage() to use
        fewer photons than normal (and so is faster) such that no more than that much extra noise
        is added to any pixel.  This is particularly useful if you will be subsequently adding sky
        noise, and you can thus tolerate more noise than the normal number of photons would give
        you, since using fewer photons is of course faster.  Finally, the default behavior is to
        have the total flux vary as a Poisson random variate, which is normally appropriate with
        photon shooting.  But you can turn this off with `poisson_flux=False`.  It also defaults to
        False if you set an explicit value for `n_photons`.

        The object will by default be drawn with its nominal center at the center location of the
        image.  There is thus a qualitative difference in the appearance of the rendered profile
        when drawn on even- and odd-sized images.  For a profile with a maximum at (0,0), this
        maximum will fall in the central pixel of an odd-sized image, but in the corner of the four
        central pixels of an even-sized image.  There are two parameters that can affect this
        behavior.  If you want the nominal center to always fall at the center of a pixel, you can
        use `use_true_center=False`.  This will put the object's center at the position
        `image.center()` which is an integer pixel value, and is not the true center of an
        even-sized image.  You can also arbitrarily offset the profile from the image center with
        the `offset` parameter to handle any sub-pixel dithering you want.

        On return, the image will have an attribute `added_flux`, which will be set to be the total
        flux added to the image.  This may be useful as a sanity check that you have provided a
        large enough image to catch most of the flux.  For example:

            >>> obj.drawImage(image)
            >>> assert image.added_flux > 0.99 * obj.getFlux()

        The appropriate threshold will depend on your particular application, including what kind
        of profile the object has, how big your image is relative to the size of your object,
        whether you are keeping `poisson_flux=True`, etc.

        Given the periodicity implicit in the use of FFTs, there can occasionally be artifacts due
        to wrapping at the edges, particularly for objects that are quite extended (e.g., due to
        the nature of the radial profile).  Use of the keyword parameter `wmult > 1` can be used to
        reduce the size of these artifacts (by making larger FFT images), at the expense of the
        calculations taking longer and using more memory.  Alternatively, the objects that go into
        the image can be created with a `gsparams` keyword that has a lower-than-default value for
        `folding_threshold`; see `help(galsim.GSParams)` for more information.

        @param image        If provided, this will be the image on which to draw the profile.
                            If `image` is None, then an automatically-sized Image will be created.
                            If `image` is given, but its bounds are undefined (e.g. if it was
                            constructed with `image = galsim.Image()`), then it will be resized
                            appropriately based on the profile's size [default: None].
        @param nx           If provided and `image` is None, use to set the x-direction size of the
                            image.  Must be accompanied by `ny`.
        @param ny           If provided and `image` is None, use to set the y-direction size of the
                            image.  Must be accompanied by `nx`.
        @param bounds       If provided and `image` is None, use to set the bounds of the image.
        @param scale        If provided, use this as the pixel scale for the image.
                            If `scale` is None and `image` is given, then take the provided
                            image's pixel scale.
                            If `scale` is None and `image` is None, then use the Nyquist scale.
                            If `scale <= 0` (regardless of `image`), then use the Nyquist scale.
                            If `scale > 0` and `image` is given, then override `image.scale` with
                            the value given as a keyword.
                            [default: None]
        @param wcs          If provided, use this as the wcs for the image (possibly overriding any
                            existing `image.wcs`).  At most one of `scale` or `wcs` may be provided.
                            [default: None]
        @param dtype        The data type to use for an automatically constructed image.  Only
                            valid if `image` is None. [default: None, which means to use
                            numpy.float32]
        @param method       Which method to use for rendering the image.  See discussion above
                            for the various options and what they do. [default: 'auto']
        @param gain         The number of photons per ADU ("analog to digital units", the units of
                            the numbers output from a CCD).  [default: 1]
        @param wmult        A multiplicative factor by which to enlarge (in each direction) the
                            default automatically calculated FFT grid size used for any
                            intermediate calculations in Fourier space.  The size of the
                            intermediate images is normally automatically chosen to reach some
                            preset accuracy targets [cf. GSParams]; however, if you see strange
                            artifacts in the image, you might try using `wmult > 1`.  This will
                            take longer of course, but it will produce more accurate images, since
                            they will have less "folding" in Fourier space. If the image size is
                            not specified, then the output real-space image will be enlarged by
                            a factor of `wmult`.  If the image size is specified by the user,
                            rather than automatically-sized, use of `wmult>1` will still affect the
                            size of the images used for the Fourier-space calculations and hence
                            can reduce image artifacts, even though the image that is returned will
                            be the requested size. [default: 1]
        @param add_to_image Whether to add flux to the existing image rather than clear out
                            anything in the image before drawing.
                            Note: This requires that `image` be provided and that it have defined
                            bounds. [default: False]
        @param use_true_center  Normally, the profile is drawn to be centered at the true center
                            of the image (using the function image.bounds.trueCenter()).
                            If you would rather use the integer center (given by
                            image.bounds.center()), set this to `False`.  [default: True]
        @param offset       The location at which to center the profile being drawn relative to the
                            center of the image (either the true center if `use_true_center=True`,
                            or the nominal center if `use_true_center=False`). [default: None]
        @param n_photons    If provided, the number of photons to use for photon shooting.
                            If not provided (i.e. `n_photons = 0`), use as many photons as
                            necessary to result in an image with the correct Poisson shot
                            noise for the object's flux.  For positive definite profiles, this
                            is equivalent to `n_photons = flux`.  However, some profiles need
                            more than this because some of the shot photons are negative
                            (usually due to interpolants).
                            [default: 0]
        @param rng          If provided, a random number generator to use for photon shooting,
                            which may be any kind of BaseDeviate object.  If `rng` is None, one
                            will be automatically created, using the time as a seed.
                            [default: None]
        @param max_extra_noise  If provided, the allowed extra noise in each pixel when photon
                            shooting.  This is only relevant if `n_photons=0`, so the number of
                            photons is being automatically calculated.  In that case, if the image
                            noise is dominated by the sky background, then you can get away with
                            using fewer shot photons than the full `n_photons = flux`.  Essentially
                            each shot photon can have a `flux > 1`, which increases the noise in
                            each pixel.  The `max_extra_noise` parameter specifies how much extra
                            noise per pixel is allowed because of this approximation.  A typical
                            value for this might be `max_extra_noise = sky_level / 100` where
                            `sky_level` is the flux per pixel due to the sky.  Note that this uses
                            a "variance" definition of noise, not a "sigma" definition.
                            [default: 0.]
        @param poisson_flux Whether to allow total object flux scaling to vary according to
                            Poisson statistics for `n_photons` samples when photon shooting.
                            [default: True, unless `n_photons` is given, in which case the default
                            is False]
        @param setup_only   Don't actually draw anything on the image.  Just make sure the image

    and the characteristic size `sigma` where the radial profile of the circular Gaussian
    drops off as `exp[-r^2 / (2. * sigma^2)]`.

    Initialization
    --------------

    A Gaussian can be initialized using one (and only one) of three possible size parameters:
    `sigma`, `fwhm`, or `half_light_radius`.  Exactly one of these three is required.

    @param sigma            The value of sigma of the profile.  Typically given in arcsec.
                            [One of `sigma`, `fwhm`, or `half_light_radius` is required.]
    @param fwhm             The full-width-half-max of the profile.  Typically given in arcsec.
                            [One of `sigma`, `fwhm`, or `half_light_radius` is required.]
    @param half_light_radius  The half-light radius of the profile.  Typically given in arcsec.
                            [One of `sigma`, `fwhm`, or `half_light_radius` is required.]
    @param flux             The flux (in photons) of the profile. [default: 1]

    @param scale_radius     The scale radius of the profile.  Typically given in arcsec.
                            [One of `scale_radius`, `fwhm`, or `half_light_radius` is required.]

class Airy(GSObject):
    """A class describing the surface brightness profile for an Airy disk (perfect
    diffraction-limited PSF for a circular aperture), with an optional central obscuration.

    For more information, refer to

        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airy_disc

    Initialization
    --------------

    The Airy profile is defined in terms of the diffraction angle, which is a function of the
    ratio lambda / D, where lambda is the wavelength of the light (say in the middle of the
    bandpass you are using) and D is the diameter of the telescope.  This ratio is the input
    parameter to pass to the Airy constructor, but as it is naturally in radians, you would
    typically convert to arcsec.  e.g.

        >>> lam = 700  # nm
        >>> diam = 4.0    # meters
        >>> lam_over_diam = (lam * 1.e-9) / diam  # radians
        >>> lam_over_diam *= 206265  # Convert to arcsec
        >>> airy = galsim.Airy(lam_over_diam)

    Or, use separate keywords for the telescope diameter and wavelength in meters and nanometers,
    respectively:

        >>> airy = galsim.Airy(lam=lam, diam=diam)

    in which case the user can also choose what units to use for internal descriptions of the light
    profile using the `scale_unit` keyword (default: galsim.arcsec).  When drawing images, users
    should then use units of `scale_unit` to specify the pixel scale.


    @param lam_over_diam    The parameter that governs the scale size of the profile.
                            See above for details about calculating it.
    @param lam              Lambda (wavelength) in units of nanometers.  Must be supplied with
                            `diam`, and in this case, image scales (`scale`) should be specified in
                            units of `scale_unit`.
    @param diam             Telescope diameter in units of meters.  Must be supplied with
                            `lam`, and in this case, image scales (`scale`) should be specified in
                            units of `scale_unit`.
    @param obscuration      The linear dimension of a central obscuration as a fraction of the
                            pupil dimension.  [default: 0]
    @param flux             The flux (in photons) of the profile. [default: 1]
    @param scale_unit       Units used to define the diffraction limit and draw images, if the user
                            has supplied a separate value for `lam` and `diam`.  Note that the
                            results of calling methods like getFWHM() will be returned in units of
                            `scale_unit`, as well.  Should be either a galsim.AngleUnit, or a string
                            that can be used to construct one (e.g., 'arcsec', 'radians', etc.).
                            [default: galsim.arcsec]
    @param gsparams         An optional GSParams argument.  See the docstring for GSParams for

    exposure atmospheric PSF.

    For more information, refer to

        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_seeing#The_Kolmogorov_model_of_turbulence

    Initialization
    --------------

    The Kolmogorov profile is normally defined in terms of the ratio lambda / r0, where lambda is
    the wavelength of the light (say in the middle of the bandpass you are using) and r0 is the
    Fried parameter.  Typical values for the Fried parameter are on the order of 10cm for
    most observatories and up to 20cm for excellent sites. The values are usually quoted at
    lambda = 500nm and r0 depends on wavelength as [r0 ~ lambda^(6/5)].

    This ratio is naturally in radians, so you would typically convert to arcsec.  e.g.

        >>> lam = 700  # nm
        >>> r0 = 0.15 * (lam/500)**1.2  # meters
        >>> lam_over_r0 = (lam * 1.e-9) / r0  # radians
        >>> lam_over_r0 *= 206265  # Convert to arcsec

    The FWHM of the Kolmogorov PSF is ~0.976 lambda/r0 (e.g., Racine 1996, PASP 699, 108).

    A Kolmogorov can be initialized using one (and only one) of three possible size parameters:
    `lam_over_r0`, `fwhm`, or `half_light_radius`.  Exactly one of these three is required.

    @param lam_over_r0      The parameter that governs the scale size of the profile.

class Sersic(GSObject):
    """A class describing a Sersic profile.

    The Sersic surface brightness profile is characterized by three properties: its Sersic index
    `n`, its `flux`, and either the `half_light_radius` or `scale_radius`.  Given these properties,
    the surface brightness profile scales as I(r) ~ exp[-(r/scale_radius)^{1/n}], or
    I(r) ~ exp[-b*(r/half_light_radius)^{1/n}] (where b is calculated to give the right
    half-light radius).

    For more information, refer to

        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sersic_profile

    Initialization
    --------------

    The allowed range of values for the `n` parameter is 0.3 <= n <= 6.2.  An exception will be
    thrown if you provide a value outside that range.  Below n=0.3, there are severe numerical
    problems.  Above n=6.2, we found that the code begins to be inaccurate when sheared or
    magnified (at the level of upcoming shear surveys), so we do not recommend extending beyond
    this.  See Issues #325 and #450 for more details.

    Sersic profile calculations take advantage of Hankel transform tables that are precomputed for a
    given value of n when the Sersic profile is initialized.  Making additional objects with the
    same n can therefore be many times faster than making objects with different values of n that
    have not been used before.  Moreover, these Hankel transforms are only cached for a maximum of
    100 different n values at a time.  For this reason, for large sets of simulations, it is worth
    considering the use of only discrete n values rather than allowing it to vary continuously.  For
    more details, see https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim/issues/566.

    Note that if you are building many Sersic profiles using truncation, the code will be more
    efficient if the truncation is always the same multiple of `scale_radius`, since it caches
    many calculations that depend on the ratio `trunc/scale_radius`.

    A Sersic can be initialized using one (and only one) of two possible size parameters:
    `scale_radius` or `half_light_radius`.  Exactly one of these two is required.

    @param n                The Sersic index, n.
    @param half_light_radius  The half-light radius of the profile.  Typically given in arcsec.
                            [One of `scale_radius` or `half_light_radius` is required.]
    @param scale_radius     The scale radius of the profile.  Typically given in arcsec.
                            [One of `scale_radius` or `half_light_radius` is required.]
    @param flux             The flux (in photons) of the profile. [default: 1]
    @param trunc            An optional truncation radius at which the profile is made to drop to
                            zero, in the same units as the size parameter.
                            [default: 0, indicating no truncation]
    @param flux_untruncated Should the provided `flux` and `half_light_radius` refer to the
                            untruncated profile? See below for more details. [default: False]
    @param gsparams         An optional GSParams argument.  See the docstring for GSParams for
                            details. [default: None]

    Flux of a truncated profile
    ---------------------------

    If you are truncating the profile, the optional parameter, `flux_untruncated`, specifies
    whether the `flux` and `half_light_radius` specifications correspond to the untruncated
    profile (`True`) or to the truncated profile (`False`, default).  The impact of this parameter
    is a little subtle, so we'll go through a few examples to show how it works.

    First, let's examine the case where we specify the size according to the half-light radius.
    If `flux_untruncated` is True (and `trunc > 0`), then the profile will be identical
    to the version without truncation up to the truncation radius, beyond which it drops to 0.
    In this case, the actual half-light radius will be different from the specified half-light
    radius.  The getHalfLightRadius() method will return the true half-light radius.  Similarly,
    the actual flux will not be the same as the specified value; the true flux is also returned
    by the getFlux() method.

    Example:

        >>> sersic_obj1 = galsim.Sersic(n=3.5, half_light_radius=2.5, flux=40.)
        >>> sersic_obj2 = galsim.Sersic(n=3.5, half_light_radius=2.5, flux=40., trunc=10.)
        >>> sersic_obj3 = galsim.Sersic(n=3.5, half_light_radius=2.5, flux=40., trunc=10., \\
                                        flux_untruncated=True)

        >>> sersic_obj1.xValue(galsim.PositionD(0.,0.))
        237.3094228615618
        >>> sersic_obj2.xValue(galsim.PositionD(0.,0.))
        142.54505376530574    # Normalization and scale radius adjusted (same half-light radius)
        >>> sersic_obj3.xValue(galsim.PositionD(0.,0.))
        237.30942286156187

        >>> sersic_obj1.xValue(galsim.PositionD(10.0001,0.))
        0.011776164687304694
        >>> sersic_obj2.xValue(galsim.PositionD(10.0001,0.))
        0.0
        >>> sersic_obj3.xValue(galsim.PositionD(10.0001,0.))
        0.0

        >>> sersic_obj1.getHalfLightRadius()
        2.5
        >>> sersic_obj2.getHalfLightRadius()
        2.5
        >>> sersic_obj3.getHalfLightRadius()
        1.9795101383056892    # The true half-light radius is smaller than the specified value

        >>> sersic_obj1.getFlux()
        40.0
        >>> sersic_obj2.getFlux()
        40.0
        >>> sersic_obj3.getFlux()
        34.56595186009519     # Flux is missing due to truncation

        >>> sersic_obj1.getScaleRadius()
        0.003262738739834598
        >>> sersic_obj2.getScaleRadius()
        0.004754602453641744  # the scale radius needed adjustment to accommodate HLR
        >>> sersic_obj3.getScaleRadius()
        0.003262738739834598  # the scale radius is still identical to the untruncated case

    When the truncated Sersic scale is specified with `scale_radius`, the behavior between the
    three cases (untruncated, `flux_untruncated=True` and `flux_untruncated=False`) will be
    somewhat different from above.  Since it is the scale radius that is being specified, and since
    truncation does not change the scale radius the way it can change the half-light radius, the
    scale radius will remain unchanged in all cases.  This also results in the half-light radius
    being the same between the two truncated cases (although different from the untruncated case).
    The flux normalization is the only difference between `flux_untruncated=True` and
    `flux_untruncated=False` in this case.

    Example:

        >>> sersic_obj1 = galsim.Sersic(n=3.5, scale_radius=0.05, flux=40.)
        >>> sersic_obj2 = galsim.Sersic(n=3.5, scale_radius=0.05, flux=40., trunc=10.)
        >>> sersic_obj3 = galsim.Sersic(n=3.5, scale_radius=0.05, flux=40., trunc=10., \\
                                        flux_untruncated=True)

        >>> sersic_obj1.xValue(galsim.PositionD(0.,0.))
        1.010507575186637
        >>> sersic_obj2.xValue(galsim.PositionD(0.,0.))
        5.786692612210923     # Normalization adjusted to accomodate the flux within trunc radius
        >>> sersic_obj3.xValue(galsim.PositionD(0.,0.))
        1.010507575186637

        >>> sersic_obj1.getHalfLightRadius()
        38.311372735390016
        >>> sersic_obj2.getHalfLightRadius()
        5.160062547614234
        >>> sersic_obj3.getHalfLightRadius()
        5.160062547614234     # For the truncated cases, the half-light radii are the same

        >>> sersic_obj1.getFlux()

    @param trunc            An optional truncation radius at which the profile is made to drop to
                            zero, in the same units as the size parameter.
                            [default: 0, indicating no truncation]
    @param flux_untruncated Should the provided `flux` and `half_light_radius` refer to the
                            untruncated profile? See the docstring for Sersic for more details.

class Spergel(GSObject):
    """A class describing a Spergel profile.

    The Spergel surface brightness profile is characterized by three properties: its Spergel index
    `nu`, its `flux`, and either the `half_light_radius` or `scale_radius`.  Given these properties,
    the surface brightness profile scales as I(r) ~ (r/scale_radius)^{nu} * K_{nu}(r/scale_radius),
    where K_{nu} is the modified Bessel function of the second kind.

    The Spergel profile is intended as a generic galaxy profile, somewhat like a Sersic profile, but
    with the advantage of being analytic in both real space and Fourier space.  The Spergel index
    `nu` plays a similar role to the Sersic index `n`, in that it adjusts the relative peakiness of
    the profile core and the relative prominence of the profile wings.  At `nu = 0.5`, the Spergel
    profile is equivalent to an Exponential profile (or alternatively an `n = 1.0` Sersic profile).
    At `nu = -0.6` (and in the radial range near the half-light radius), the Spergel profile is
    similar to a DeVaucouleurs profile or `n = 4.0` Sersic profile.

    Note that for `nu <= 0.0`, the Spergel profile surface brightness diverges at the origin.  This
    may lead to rendering problems if the profile is not convolved by either a PSF or a pixel and
    the profile center is precisely on a pixel center.

    Due to its analytic Fourier transform and depending on the indices `n` and `nu`, the Spergel
    profile can be considerably faster to draw than the roughly equivalent Sersic profile.  For
    example, the `nu = -0.6` Spergel profile is roughly 3x faster to draw than an `n = 4.0` Sersic
    profile once the Sersic profile cache has been set up.  However, if not taking advantage of
    the cache, for example, if drawing Sersic profiles with `n` continuously varying near 4.0 and
    Spergel profiles with `nu` continuously varying near -0.6, then the Spergel profiles are about
    50x faster to draw.  At the other end of the galaxy profile spectrum, the `nu = 0.5` Spergel
    profile, `n = 1.0` Sersic profile, and the Exponential profile all take about the same amount
    of time to draw if cached, and the Spergel profile is about 2x faster than the Sersic profile
    if uncached.

    Initialization
    --------------

    The allowed range of values for the `nu` parameter is -0.85 <= nu <= 4.  An exception will be
    thrown if you provide a value outside that range.  The lower limit is set above the theoretical
    lower limit of -1 due to numerical difficulties integrating the *very* peaky nu < -0.85
    profiles.  The upper limit is set to avoid numerical difficulties evaluating the modified
    Bessel function of the second kind.

    A Spergel profile can be initialized using one (and only one) of two possible size parameters:
    `scale_radius` or `half_light_radius`.  Exactly one of these two is required.

GSParams.__doc__ = """
GSParams stores a set of numbers that govern how GSObjects make various speed/accuracy tradeoff
decisions.  All GSObjects can take an optional parameter named `gsparams`, which would be an
instance of this class.  e.g.

    >>> gsp = galsim.GSParams(folding_threshold=1.e-3)
    >>> gal = galsim.Sersic(n=3.4, half_light_radius=3.2, flux=200, gsparams=gsp)

Note that `gsparams` needs to be provided when the object is initialized, rather than when the
object is drawn (as would perhaps be slightly more intuitive), because most of the relevant
approximations happen during the initialization of the object, rather than during the actual
rendering.

Initialization
--------------

All parameters have reasonable default values.  You only need to specify the ones you want
to change.

@param minimum_fft_size     The minimum size of any FFT that may need to be performed.
                            [default: 128]
@param maximum_fft_size     The maximum allowed size of an image for performing an FFT.  This
                            is more about memory use than accuracy.  We have this maximum
                            value to help prevent the user from accidentally trying to perform
                            an extremely large FFT that crashes the program. Instead, GalSim
                            will raise an exception indicating that the image is too large,
                            which is often a sign of an error in the user's code. However, if
                            you have the memory to handle it, you can raise this limit to
                            allow the calculation to happen. [default: 4096]
@param folding_threshold    This sets a maximum amount of real space folding that is allowed,
                            an effect caused by the periodic nature of FFTs.  FFTs implicitly
                            use periodic boundary conditions, and a profile specified on a
                            finite grid in Fourier space corresponds to a real space image
                            that will have some overlap with the neighboring copies of the real
                            space profile.  As the step size in k increases, the spacing between
                            neighboring aliases in real space decreases, increasing the amount of
                            folded, overlapping flux.  `folding_threshold` is used to set an
                            appropriate step size in k to allow at most this fraction of the flux
                            to be folded.
                            This parameter is also relevant when you let GalSim decide how large
                            an image to use for your object.  The image is made to be large enough
                            that at most a fraction `folding_threshold` of the total flux is
                            allowed to fall off the edge of the image. [default: 5.e-3]
@param stepk_minimum_hlr    In addition to the above constraint for aliasing, also set stepk
                            such that pi/stepk is at least `stepk_minimum_hlr` times the
                            profile's half-light radius (for profiles that have a well-defined
                            half-light radius). [default: 5]
@param maxk_threshold       This sets the maximum amplitude of the high frequency modes in
                            Fourier space that are excluded by truncating the FFT at some
                            maximum k value. Lowering this parameter can help minimize the
                            effect of "ringing" if you see that in your images. [default: 1.e-3]
@param kvalue_accuracy      This sets the accuracy of values in Fourier space. Whenever there is
                            some kind of approximation to be made in the calculation of a
                            Fourier space value, the error in the approximation is constrained
                            to be no more than this value times the total flux. [default: 1.e-5]
@param xvalue_accuracy      This sets the accuracy of values in real space. Whenever there is
                            some kind of approximation to be made in the calculation of a
                            real space value, the error in the approximation is constrained
                            to be no more than this value times the total flux. [default: 1.e-5]
@param table_spacing        Several profiles use lookup tables for either the Hankel transform
                            (Sersic, Moffat) or the real space radial function (Kolmogorov).
                            We try to estimate a good spacing between values in the lookup
                            tables based on either `xvalue_accuracy` or `kvalue_accuracy` as
                            appropriate. However, you may change the spacing with this
                            parameter. Using `table_spacing < 1` will use a spacing value that
                            is that much smaller than the default, which should produce more
                            accurate interpolations. [default: 1]
@param realspace_relerr     This sets the relative error tolerance for real-space integration.
                            [default: 1.e-4]
@param realspace_abserr     This sets the absolute error tolerance for real-space integration.
                            [default: 1.e-6]
                            The estimated integration error for the flux value in each pixel
                            when using the real-space rendering method (either explicitly with
                            `method='real_space'` or if it is triggered automatically with
                            `method='auto'`) is constrained to be no larger than either
                            `realspace_relerr` times the pixel flux or `realspace_abserr`
                            times the object's total flux.
@param integration_relerr   The relative error tolerance for integrations other than real-space
                            rendering. [default: 1.e-6]
@param integration_abserr   The absolute error tolerance for integrations other than real-space
                            rendering. [default: 1.e-8]
@param shoot_accuracy       This sets the relative accuracy on the total flux when photon
                            shooting.  The photon shooting algorithm at times needs to make
                            approximations, such as how high in radius it needs to sample the
                            radial profile. When such approximations need to be made, it makes
                            sure that the resulting fractional error in the flux will be at
                            most this much. [default: 1.e-5]
allowed_flux_variation      The maximum range of allowed (abs value of) photon fluxes within
                            an interval before the rejection sampling algorithm is invoked for
                            photon shooting. [default: 0.81]
range_division_for_extrema  The number of parts into which to split a range to bracket extrema
                            when photon shooting. [default: 32]
small_fraction_of_flux      When photon shooting, intervals with less than this fraction of
                            probability are considered ok to use with the dominant-sampling
                            algorithm. [default: 1.e-4]
