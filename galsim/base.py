                      This is only relevant if n_photons=0, so the number of photons is being 
                      automatically calculated.  In that case, if the image noise is 
                      dominated by the sky background, you can get away with using fewer
                      shot photons than the full n_photons = flux.  Essentially each shot photon
                      can have a flux > 1, which increases the noise in each pixel.
                      The noise parameter specifies how much extra noise per pixel is allowed 
                      because of this approximation.  A typical value for this might be
                      noise = sky_level / 100 where sky_level is the flux per pixel 
                      due to the sky.  If the natural number of photons produces less noise 
                      than this value for all pixels, we lower the number of photons to bring 
                      the resultant noise up to this value.  If the natural value produces 
                      more noise than this, we accept it and just use the natural value.
                      Note that this uses a "variance" definition of noise, not a "sigma" 
                      definition.
                      (Default = 0.)
        @param poisson_flux  Whether to allow total object flux scaling to vary according to 
                             Poisson statistics for n_photons samples.
                             (Default = True)
        @param add_to_image  Whether to add flux to the existing image rather than clear out
                             anything in the image before shooting.
                             (Default = False)
                              
        @returns  The tuple (image, added_flux), where image is the input with drawn photons 
                  added and added_flux is the total flux of photons that landed inside the image 
                  bounds.

        The second part of the return tuple may be useful as a sanity check that you have
        provided a large enough image to catch most of the flux.  For example:
        @code
        image, added_flux = obj.drawShoot(image)
        assert added_flux > 0.99 * obj.getFlux()
        @endcode
        However, the appropriate threshold will depend things like whether you are 
        keeping poisson_flux=True, how high the flux is, how big your images are relative to
        the size of your object, etc.

        The input image must have defined boundaries and pixel scale.  The photons generated by
        the drawShoot() method will be binned into the target image.  The input image will be 
        cleared before drawing in the photons by default, unless the keyword add_to_image is 
        set to True.  Scale and location of the image pixels will not be altered. 

        It is important to remember that the image produced by drawShoot() represents the object
        as convolved with the square image pixel.  So when using drawShoot() instead of draw(),
        you should not convolve with a Pixel.  This will produce the equivalent image (for very 
        large n_photons) as draw() produces when the same object is convolved with Pixel(xw=dx) 
        when drawing onto an image with pixel scale dx.

    The objects to be convolved may be provided either as multiple unnamed arguments
    (e.g. Convolve(psf,gal,pix)) or as a list (e.g. Convolve[psf,gal,pix]).
    Any number of objects may be provided using either syntax.  (Even 0 or 1, although
    that doesn't really make much sense.)
   
    The convolution will normally be done using discrete Fourier transforms of 
    each of the component profiles, multiplying them together, and then transforming
    back to real space.
   
    The stepK used for the k-space image will be (Sum 1/stepK()^2)^(-1/2)
    where the sum is over all teh components being convolved.  Since the size of 
    the convolved image scales roughly as the quadrature sum of the components,
    this should be close to Pi/Rmax where Rmax is the radius that encloses
    all but (1-alias_threshold) of the flux in the final convolved image..
    
    The maxK used for the k-space image will be the minimum of the maxK calculated for
    each component.  Since the k-space images are multiplied, if one of them is 
    essentially zero beyond some k value, then that will be true of the final image
    as well.
    
    There is also an option to do the convolution as integrals in real space.
    To do this, use the optional keyword argument real_space=True.
    Currently, the real-space integration is only enabled for 2 profiles.
    (Aside from the trivial implementaion for 1 profile.)  If you try to use it 
    for more than 2 profiles, an exception will be raised.
    
    The real-space convolution is normally slower than the DFT convolution.
    The exception is if both component profiles have hard edges.  e.g. a truncated
    Moffat with a Pixel.  In that case, the maxK for each component is quite large
    since the ringing dies off fairly slowly.  So it can be quicker to use 
    real-space convolution instead.  Also, real-space convolution tends to be more
    accurate in this case as well.

    If you do not specify either True or False explicitly, then we check if 
    there are 2 profiles, both of which have hard edges.  In this case, we 
    automatically use real-space convolution.  In all other cases, the

    ...Tab completion now works in ipython (it didn't with the bot.git version on my build) since
    attributes are actually added to __dict__.
    
    HOWEVER this means I have redefined the __dict__ attribute to be a collections.defaultdict()

    I prefer this, as a newbie who uses ipython and the tab completion function to aid development,
    but does it potentially break something down the line or add undesirable behaviour? (I guessed
    not, since collections.defaultdict objects have all the usual dict() methods, but I cannot be
