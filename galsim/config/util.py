    A note about the nomenclature here.  We use the term "job" to mean the job of building a single
    file or image or stamp.  The output of each job is gathered into the list of results that
    is returned.  A task is a collection of one or more jobs that are all done by the same
    processor.  For simple cases, each task is just a single job, but for things like a Ring
    test, the task needs to have the jobs for a full ring.

    The tasks argument is a list of tasks.
    Each task in that list is a list of jobs.
    Each job is a tuple consisting of (kwargs, k), where kwargs is the dict of kwargs to pass to
    the job_func and k is the index of this job in the full list of jobs.

                        a tuple (kwargs, k).
        item:           A string indicating what is being worked on.
        logger:         If given, a logger object to log progress. [default: None]
        timeout:        How many seconds to allow for each task before timing out. [default: 900]
        done_func:      A function to run upon completion of each job.  It will be called as::

                            done_func(logger, proc, k, result, t)

                        where proc is the process name, k is the index of the job, result is
                        the return value of that job, and t is the time taken. [default: None]
        except_func:    A function to run if an exception is encountered.  It will be called as::

                            except_func(logger, proc, k, ex, tr)

                        where proc is the process name, k is the index of the job that failed,
                        ex is the exception caught, and tr is the traceback. [default: None]
