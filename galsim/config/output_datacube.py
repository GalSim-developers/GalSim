        A point of attention for DataCubes is that they must all be the same size.
        This function builds the first image alone, finds out its size and then forces
        all subsequent images to be the same size.

        Parameters:
            config:         The configuration dict for the output field.
            base:           The base configuration dict.
            file_num:       The current file_num.

            obj_num:        The current obj_num.

                            ignore here.  i.e. it won't be an error if they are present.
