# The weight extra output type builds an ImageF of the inverse noise variance in the image.
# It builds up the variance either from the stamp information if noise is being added then
# or at the end from the full image if that is when noise is added.  Then at the end of
# the image processing, it inverts the image to get the appropriate weight map.

    """This builds a weight map image to go along with each regular data image.

    The weight is the inverse variance of the noise in the image.

    There is a option called 'include_obj_var' that governs whether the weight should include the
    Poisson variance of the signal.  In real data, you don't know the true signal, and estimating
    the Poisson noise from the realized image can lead to biases.  As such, different applications
    may or may not want this included.
