# The truth extra output type builds an OutputCatalog with truth information about each of the
# objects being built by the configuration processing.  It stores the appropriate row information
# in scratch space for each stamp and then adds them in order at the end of the file processing.
# This means that the stamps can be built out of order by the multiprocessing and still show
# up in the correct order in the output catalog.

# Note that the order of the column names in the output catalog is taken from
# config['output']['truth']['columns'].keys().  So if config is a regular dict, the order
# of the keys is semi-arbitrary.  However, if config is an OrderedDict, the keys come out
# in the order specified.  The standard galsim executable reads the config file into an
# OrderedDict for precisely this reason.
