class lazy_property:
    """
    This decorator will act similarly to @property, but will be efficient for multiple access
    to values that require some significant calculation.

    It works by replacing the attribute with the computed value, so after the first access,
    the property (an attribute of the class) is superseded by the new attribute of the instance.

    Note that is should only be used for non-mutable data, since the calculation will not be
    repeated if anything about the instance changes.

    Usage::

        @lazy_property
        def slow_function_to_be_used_as_a_property(self):
            x =  ...  # Some slow calculation.
            return x
