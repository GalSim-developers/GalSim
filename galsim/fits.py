class FitsHeader(object):
    """A class storing key/value pairs from a FITS Header

    This class works a lot like the regular read() function, but rather than returning
    the image part of the FITS file, it gives you access to the header information.

    After construction, you can access a header value by

        >>> value = fits_header[key]

    or write to it with

        >>> fits_header[key] = value                # If you just want to set a value.
        >>> fits_header[key] = (value, comment)     # If you want to include a comment field.

    In fact, most of the normal functions available for a dict are available:
    
        >>> keys = fits_header.keys()
        >>> items = fits_header.items()
        >>> for key in fits_header:
        >>>     value = fits_header[key]
        >>> value = fits_header.get(key, default)
        >>> del fits_header[key]
        >>> etc.

    This is a particularly useful abstraction, since pyfits has changed its syntax for how 
    to write to a fits header, so this class will work regardless of which version of pyfits
    (or astropy.io.fits) is installed.

    The underlying pyfits.Header object is available as a `.header` attribute:

        >>> pyf_header = fits_header.header

    A FitsHeader may be constructed from a file name, an open PyFits (or astropy.io.fits) HDUList
    object, or a PyFits (or astropy.io.fits) Header object.  It can also be constructed with
    no parameters, in which case a blank Header will be constructed with no keywords yet if 
    you want to add the keywords you want by hand.

        >>> h1 = galsim.FitsHeader(file_name = file_name)
        >>> h2 = galsim.FitsHeader(header = header)
        >>> h3 = galsim.FitsHeader(hdu_list = hdu_list)
        >>> h4 = galsim.FitsHeader()

    For convenience, the first parameter may be unnamed as either a header or a file_name:

        >>> h1 = galsim.FitsHeader(file_name)
        >>> h2 = galsim.FitsHeader(header)

    Constructor parameters:
