class LookupTable(object):
    """
    LookupTable represents a lookup table to store function values that may be slow to calculate,
    for which interpolating from a lookup table is sufficiently accurate.

    A LookupTable may be constructed from two arrays (lists, tuples, or Numpy arrays of 
    floats/doubles).

        args = [...]
        vals = []
        for arg in args:
            val = calculateVal(arg)
            vals.append(val)
        table = galsim.LookupTable(x=args,f=vals)

    Then you can use this table as a replacement for the slow calculation:

        other_args = [...]
        for arg in other_args:
            val = table(arg)
            [... use val ...]


    The default interpolation method is cubic spline interpolation.  This is usually the 
    best choice, but we also provide three other options, which can be specified by
    the `interpolant` kwarg.  The choices are 'floor', 'ceil', 'linear' and 'spline':

    - 'floor' takes the value from the previous argument in the table.
    - 'ceil' takes the value from the next argument in the table.
    - 'linear' does linear interpolation between these two values.
    - 'spline' uses a cubic spline interpolation, so the interpolated values are smooth at 
      each argument in the table.

    Another option is to read in the values from an ascii file.  The file should have two 
    columns of numbers, which are taken to be the x and f values.

    The user can also opt to interpolate in log(x) and/or log(f), though this is not the default.
    It may be a wise choice depending on the particular function, e.g., for a nearly power-law
    f(x) (or at least one that is locally power-law-ish for much of the x range) then it might 
    be a good idea to interpolate in log(x) and log(f) rather than x and f.

    @param x             The list, tuple, or Numpy array of x values (floats, doubles, or ints,
                         which get silently converted to floats for the purpose of interpolation).
    @param f             The list, tuple, or Numpy array of f(x) values (floats, doubles, or ints,
                         which get silently converted to floats for the purpose of interpolation).
    @param interpolant   The interpolant to use, with the options being 'floor', 'ceil', 
                         'linear' and 'spline'. [Default `interpolant = 'spline'`]
    @param file          A file from which to read the (x,f) pairs.
    @param x_log         Set to True if you wish to interpolate using log(x) rather than x.  Note
                         that all inputs / outputs will still be x, it's just a question of how the
                         interpolation is done. [Default `x_log = False`]
    @param f_log         Set to True if you wish to interpolate using log(f) rather than f.  Note
                         that all inputs / outputs will still be f, it's just a question of how the
                         interpolation is done. [Default `f_log = False`]
