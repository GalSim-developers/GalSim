from ..errors import GalSimDeprecationWarning

def depr(f, v, s1, s2=None):
    """A helper function for emitting a GalSimDeprecationWarning.

    Example usage:

    1. Normally, you would simply warn that a deprecated function has a new preferred syntax:

            depr('applyShear', 1.1, 'obj = obj.shear(..)')

    2. You can add extra information if you want to point out something about the new syntax:

            depr('draw', 1.1, "drawImage(..., method='no_pixel')",
                 'Note: drawImage has different args than draw did.  '
                 'Read the docs for the method keywords carefully.')

    3. If the deprecated function has no replacement, you can use '' for the first string.

            depr('calculateCovarianceMatrix', 1.3, '',
                 'This functionality has been removed. If you have a need for it, please open '
                 'an issue requesting the functionality.')
    """
    import warnings
    s = str(f)+' has been deprecated since GalSim version '+str(v)+'.'
    if s1:
        s += '  Use '+s1+' instead.'
    if s2:
        s += '  ' + s2
    warnings.warn(s, GalSimDeprecationWarning)
