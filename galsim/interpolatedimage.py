InterpolatedImage is a class that allows one to treat an image as a profile.

import galsim
from galsim import GSObject


class InterpolatedImage(GSObject):
    """A class describing non-parametric profiles specified using an Image, which can be 
    interpolated for the purpose of carrying out transformations.

    The InterpolatedImage class is useful if you have a non-parametric description of an object as 
    an Image, that you wish to manipulate / transform using GSObject methods such as applyShear(),
    applyMagnification(), applyShift(), etc.  The input Image can be any BaseImage (i.e., Image,
    ImageView, or ConstImageView).  Note that when convolving an InterpolatedImage, the use of
    real-space convolution is not recommended, since it is typically a great deal slower than 
    Fourier-space convolution for this kind of object.

    The constructor needs to know how the Image was drawn: is it an Image of flux or of surface
    brightness?  Since our default for drawing Images using draw() and drawShoot() is that
    `normalization == 'flux'` (i.e., sum of pixel values equals the object flux), the default for 
    the InterpolatedImage class is to assume the same flux normalization.  However, the user can 
    specify 'surface brightness' normalization if desired, or alternatively, can instead specify 
    the desired flux for the object.

    If the input Image has a scale associated with it, then there is no need to specify an input
    scale `dx`.

    The user may optionally specify an interpolant, `x_interpolant`, for real-space manipulations
    (e.g., shearing, resampling).  If none is specified, then by default, a Quintic polynomial
    interpolant is used.  The user may also choose to specify two quantities that can affect the
    Fourier space convolution: the k-space interpolant (`k_interpolant`) and the amount of padding
    to include around the original images (`pad_factor`).  The default values for `x_interpolant`,
    `k_interpolant`, and `pad_factor` were chosen based on preliminary tests suggesting that they
    lead to a high degree of accuracy without being excessively slow.  Users should be particularly
    wary about changing `k_interpolant` and `pad_factor` from the defaults without careful testing.
    The user is given complete freedom to choose interpolants and pad factors, and no warnings are
    raised when the code is modified to choose some combination that is known to give significant
    error.  More details can be found in devel/modules/finterp.pdf, especially table 1, in the
    GalSim repository.

    The user can choose to pad the image with a noise profile if desired.  To do so, specify
    the target size for the noise padding in `noise_pad_size`, and specify the kind of noise
    to use in `noise_pad`.  The `noise_pad` option may be a Gaussian random noise of some variance,
    or a Gaussian but correlated noise field that is specified either as a CorrelatedNoise 
    instance, an Image (from which a correlated noise model is derived), or a string (interpreted 
    as a filename containing an image to use for deriving a CorrelatedNoise).  The user can also 
    pass in a random number generator to be used for noise generation.  Finally, the user can pass 
    in a `pad_image` for deterministic image padding.

    By default, the InterpolatedImage recalculates the Fourier-space step and number of points to
    use for further manipulations, rather than using the most conservative possibility.  For typical
    objects representing galaxies and PSFs this can easily make the difference between several
    seconds (conservative) and 0.04s (recalculated).  However, the user can turn off this option,
    and may especially wish to do so when using images that do not contain a high S/N object - e.g.,
    images of noise fields.

    Initialization
    --------------
    
        >>> interpolated_image = galsim.InterpolatedImage(
                image, x_interpolant = None, k_interpolant = None, normalization = 'flux',
                dx = None, flux = None, pad_factor = 4., noise_pad_size = 0, noise_pad = 0.,
                use_cache = True, pad_image = None, rng = None, calculate_stepk = True,
                calculate_maxk = True, use_true_center = True, offset = None)

    Initializes interpolated_image as a galsim.InterpolatedImage() instance.

    For comparison of the case of padding with noise or zero when the image itself includes noise,
    compare `im1` and `im2` from the following code snippet (which can be executed from the
    examples/ directory):

        image = galsim.fits.read('data/147246.0_150.416558_1.998697_masknoise.fits')
        int_im1 = galsim.InterpolatedImage(image)
        int_im2 = galsim.InterpolatedImage(image, noise_pad='../tests/blankimg.fits')
        im1 = galsim.ImageF(1000,1000)
        im2 = galsim.ImageF(1000,1000)
        int_im1.draw(im1)
        int_im2.draw(im2)

    Examination of these two images clearly shows how padding with a correlated noise field that is
    similar to the one in the real data leads to a more reasonable appearance for the result when
    re-drawn at a different size.

    @param image           The Image from which to construct the object.
                           This may be either an Image (or ImageView) instance or a string
                           indicating a fits file from which to read the image.
    @param x_interpolant   Either an Interpolant2d (or Interpolant) instance or a string indicating
                           which real-space interpolant should be used.  Options are 'nearest',
                           'sinc', 'linear', 'cubic', 'quintic', or 'lanczosN' where N should be the
                           integer order to use. (Default `x_interpolant = galsim.Quintic()`)
    @param k_interpolant   Either an Interpolant2d (or Interpolant) instance or a string indicating
                           which k-space interpolant should be used.  Options are 'nearest', 'sinc',
                           'linear', 'cubic', 'quintic', or 'lanczosN' where N should be the integer
                           order to use.  We strongly recommend leaving this parameter at its
                           default value; see text above for details.  (Default `k_interpolant =
                           galsim.Quintic()`)
    @param normalization   Two options for specifying the normalization of the input Image:
                              "flux" or "f" means that the sum of the pixels is normalized
                                  to be equal to the total flux.
                              "surface brightness" or "sb" means that the pixels sample
                                  the surface brightness distribution at each location.
                              (Default `normalization = "flux"`)
    @param dx              If provided, use this as the pixel scale for the Image; this will
                           override the pixel scale stored by the provided Image, in any.  If `dx`
                           is `None`, then take the provided image's pixel scale.
                           (Default `dx = None`.)
    @param flux            Optionally specify a total flux for the object, which overrides the
                           implied flux normalization from the Image itself.
    @param pad_factor      Factor by which to pad the Image with zeros.  We strongly recommend 
                           leaving this parameter at its default value; see text above for details. 
                           (Default `pad_factor = 4`)
    @param noise_pad_size  If provided, the image will be padded out to this size (in arcsec) with 
                           the noise specified by `noise_pad`. This is important if you are 
                           planning to whiten the resulting image.  You want to make sure that the 
                           noise-padded image is larger than the postage stamp onto which you are 
                           drawing this object.  [Default `noise_pad_size = None`.]
    @param noise_pad       Noise properties to use when padding the original image with
                           noise.  This can be specified in several ways:
                               (a) as a float, which is interpreted as being a variance to use when
                                   padding with uncorrelated Gaussian noise; 
                               (b) as a galsim.CorrelatedNoise, which contains information about the
                                   desired noise power spectrum - any random number generator passed
                                   to the `rng` keyword will take precedence over that carried in an
                                   input galsim.CorrelatedNoise;
                               (c) as a galsim.Image of a noise field, which is used to calculate
                                   the desired noise power spectrum; or
                               (d) as a string which is interpreted as a filename containing an
                                   example noise field with the proper noise power spectrum.
                           It is important to keep in mind that the calculation of the correlation
                           function that is internally stored within a galsim.CorrelatedNoise is a 
                           non-negligible amount of overhead, so the recommended means of specifying
                           a correlated noise field for padding are (b) or (d). In the case of (d),
                           if the same file is used repeatedly, then the `use_cache` keyword (see 
                           below) can be used to prevent the need for repeated 
                           galsim.CorrelatedNoise initializations.
                           (Default `noise_pad = 0.`, i.e., pad with zeros.)
    @param use_cache       Specify whether to cache noise_pad read in from a file to save having
                           to build a CorrelatedNoise object repeatedly from the same image.
                           (Default `use_cache = True`)
    @param rng             If padding by noise, the user can optionally supply the random noise
                           generator to use for drawing random numbers as `rng` (may be any kind of
                           `galsim.BaseDeviate` object).  Such a user-input random number generator
                           takes precedence over any stored within a user-input CorrelatedNoise 
                           instance (see the `noise_pad` param).
                           If `rng=None`, one will be automatically created, using the time as a
                           seed. (Default `rng = None`)
    @param pad_image       Image to be used for deterministically padding the original image.  This
                           can be specified in two ways:
                               (a) as a galsim.Image; or
                               (b) as a string which is interpreted as a filename containing an
                                   image to use.
                           The `pad_image` scale is ignored, and taken to be equal to that
                           of the `image`.
                           The user should be careful to ensure that the image used for padding has 
                           roughly zero mean.  The purpose of this keyword is to allow for a more 
                           flexible representation of some noise field around an object; if the 
                           user wishes to represent the sky level around an object, they should do 
                           that after they have drawn the final image instead.  
                           (Default `pad_image = None`.)
    @param calculate_stepk Specify whether to perform an internal determination of the extent of 
                           the object being represented by the InterpolatedImage; often this is 
                           useful in choosing an optimal value for the stepsize in the Fourier 
                           space lookup table.  
                           If you know a priori an appropriate maximum value for stepk, then 
                           you may also supply that here instead of a bool value, in which case
                           the stepk value is still calculated, but will not go above the
                           provided value. 
                           (Default `calculate_stepk = True`)
    @param calculate_maxk  Specify whether to perform an internal determination of the highest 
                           spatial frequency needed to accurately render the object being 
                           represented by the InterpolatedImage; often this is useful in choosing 
                           an optimal value for the extent of the Fourier space lookup table.
                           If you know a priori an appropriate maximum value for maxk, then 
                           you may also supply that here instead of a bool value, in which case
                           the maxk value is still calculated, but will not go above the
                           provided value. 
                           (Default `calculate_maxk = True`)
    @param use_true_center Similar to the same parameter in the GSObject.draw function, this
                           sets whether to use the true center of the provided image as the 
                           center of the profile (if `use_true_center=True`) or the nominal
                           center returned by `image.bounds.center()` (if `use_true_center=False`)
                           [Default `use_true_center = True`]
    @param offset          The location in the input image to use as the center of the profile.
                           This should be specified relative to the center of the input image 
                           (either the true center if use_true_center=True, or the nominal center 
                           if use_true_center=False).  [Default `offset = None`]
    @param gsparams        You may also specify a gsparams argument.  See the docstring for
                           galsim.GSParams using help(galsim.GSParams) for more information about
                           this option.
