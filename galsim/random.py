# BaseDeviate docstrings
_galsim.BaseDeviate.__doc__ = """
Base class for all the various random deviates.

This holds the essential random number generator that all the other classes use.

All deviates have three constructors that define different ways of setting up the random number
generator.

  1) Only the arguments particular to the derived class (e.g. mean and sigma for GaussianDeviate).
     In this case, a new random number generator is created and it is seeded using the computer's
     microsecond counter.

  2) Using a particular seed as the first argument to the constructor.
     This will also create a new random number generator, but seed it with the provided value.

  3) Passing another BaseDeviate as the first arguemnt to the constructor.
     This will make the new Deviate share the same underlying random number generator with the other
     Deviate.  So you can make one Deviate (of any type), and seed it with a particular
     deterministic value.  Then if you pass that Deviate to any other one you make, they will all be
     using the same RNG and have a particular deterministic series of values.  (It doesn't have to
     be the first one -- any one you've made later can also be used to seed a new one.)
     
There is not much you can do with something that is only known to be a BaseDeviate rather than one
of the derived classes other than construct it and change the seed, and use it as an argument to
pass to other Deviate constructors.

Parameters:

    rng         A BaseDeviate instance to use for generating the random numbers.
    sky_level   The sky level in electrons per pixel that was originally in the input image, 
                but which is taken to have already been subtracted off [default `sky_level = 0.`].
    gain        The gain for each pixel in electrons per ADU; setting gain<=0 will shut off the
                Poisson noise, and the Gaussian rms will take the value read_noise as being in 
                units of ADU rather than electrons [default `gain = 1.`].
    read_noise  The read noise on each pixel in electrons (gain > 0.) or ADU (gain <= 0.)
                setting read_noise=0. will shut off the Gaussian noise [default `read_noise = 0.`].

Methods
-------
To add noise to every element of an image, use the syntax image.addNoise(ccd_noise).
"""

_galsim.CCDNoise.applyTo.__func__.__doc__ = """
Add noise to an input Image.

Calling
-------

    >>> ccd_noise.applyTo(image)

On output the Image instance image will have been given additional stochastic noise according to 
the gain and read noise settings of the given CCDNoise instance.

Note: the syntax image.addNoise(ccd_noise) is preferred.

_galsim.DeviateNoise.__doc__ = """
Class implementing noise with an arbitrary BaseDeviate object.

The DeviateNoise class provides a way to treat an arbitrary deviate as the noise model for 
each pixel in an image.

Initialization
--------------

    >>> dev_noise = galsim.DeviateNoise(dev)

Parameters:

    dev         A BaseDeviate subclass to use as the noise deviate for each pixel.

Methods
-------
To add noise to every element of an image, use the syntax image.addNoise(dev_noise).
