"""Module containing the optical PSF generation routines.

Currently these are just functions; the plan will be for these to be included as methods in some
kind of 'optical' class, or perhaps as methods in a more fundamental psf class.

They work in largely dimensionless units.  The size of the optical PSF is specified using the kmax
input parameter, where kmax is the bandlimit of the optical MTF and kmax = pi (default) is the
Nyquist frequency for the generated image.

This default kmax therefore produces the *smallest* image of an optical PSF model that is not
undersampled.  Most likely, you will want to specify kmax < pi to generate larger, nice,
high-resolution oversampled images of the optical PSF!  But this is, of course, up to you.
kmax = pi is chosen as default since it is a clearly understandable physical scale for the image.

Glossary of key terms used in function names:

PSF = point spread function

OTF = optical transfer function = FT{PSF}

MTF = modulation transfer function = |FT{PSF}|

PTF = phase transfer function = p, where OTF = MTF * exp(i * p)

Wavefront = the amplitude and phase of the incident light on the telescope pupil, encoded as a
complex number. The OTF is the autocorrelation function of the wavefront.

TODO: Implement a centrally-obstructed pupil plane (e.g. such as is caused by secondary mirrors).

    Outputs a complex image (shape=array_shape) of a circular pupil wavefront that will
    produce a PSF with bandlimit kmax.  We adopt the conventions of SBProfile so that the Nyquist
    frequency of an image with unit integer pixel spacing is pi.

    The default output is a circular pupil of radius pi/2 in k-space (`= kmax / 2`), i.e. one
    which fills to a diameter of half the array dimension.  The OTF thus has maximum radius pi in
    k-space at this default kmax, and so the output PSF will be fully sampled (just).

    Typically, therefore, kmax should be chosen to be less than pi and will depend on the pixel
    scale desired in the output.
    
    The pupil sample locations are arranged in standard DFT element ordering format, so that
    (kx, ky) = (0, 0) is the [0, 0] array element.
