"""@file optics.py @brief Module containing the optical PSF generation routines.

These are just functions; they are used to generate galsim.Optics() class instances (see base.py).

They work in largely dimensionless units.  The size of the optical PSF is specified using the kmax
input parameter, where kmax is the bandlimit of the optical MTF and kmax = pi (default) is the
Nyquist frequency for the generated image.

This default kmax therefore produces the *smallest* image of an optical PSF model that is not
undersampled.  Most likely, you will want to specify kmax < pi to generate larger, nice,
high-resolution oversampled images of the optical PSF!  But this is, of course, up to you.
kmax = pi is chosen as default since it is a clearly understandable physical scale for the image.

Glossary of key terms used in function names:

PSF = point spread function

OTF = optical transfer function = FT{PSF}

MTF = modulation transfer function = |FT{PSF}|

PTF = phase transfer function = p, where OTF = MTF * exp(i * p)

Wavefront = the amplitude and phase of the incident light on the telescope pupil, encoded as a
complex number. The OTF is the autocorrelation function of the wavefront.

TODO: Implement a centrally-obstructed pupil plane (e.g. such as is caused by secondary mirrors).
