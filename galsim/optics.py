Module containing the optical PSF generation routines.

These are just functions; they are used to generate galsim.OpticalPSF() class instances (see 
base.py).   

Mostly they are solely of use to developers for generating arrays that may be useful in defining 
GSObjects with an optical component.  They will not therefore be used in a typical image simulation
workflow: users will find most of what they need simply using the OpticalPSF() class.

Glossary of key terms used in function names:

PSF = point spread function

OTF = optical transfer function = FT{PSF}

MTF = modulation transfer function = |FT{PSF}|

PTF = phase transfer function = p, where OTF = MTF * exp(i * p)

Wavefront = the amplitude and phase of the incident light on the telescope pupil, encoded as a
complex number. The OTF is the autocorrelation function of the wavefront.

class OpticalPSF(GSObject):
    """A class describing aberrated PSFs due to telescope optics.  It's underlying implementation
    uses an InterpolatedImage to characterize the profile.

    Input aberration coefficients are assumed to be supplied in units of wavelength, and correspond
    to the Zernike polynomials in the Noll convention definined in
    Noll, J. Opt. Soc. Am. 66, 207-211(1976).  For a brief summary of the polynomials, refer to
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zernike_polynomials#Zernike_polynomials.

    You can also optionally specify that the secondary mirror (or prime focus cage, etc.) are held
    by some number of support struts.  These are taken to be rectangular obscurations extending from
    the outer edge of the pupil to the outer edge of the obscuration disk (or the pupil center if
    `obscuration = 0.`).  You can specify how many struts there are (evenly spaced in angle), how
    thick they are as a fraction of the pupil diameter, and what angle they start at relative to
    the positive y direction.

    Initializes optical_psf as a galsim.OpticalPSF() instance.

    @param lam_over_diam    Lambda / telescope diameter in the physical units adopted for dx 
                            (user responsible for consistency).
    @param defocus          Defocus in units of incident light wavelength.
    @param astig1           Astigmatism (like e2) in units of incident light wavelength.

    @param trefoil1         Trefoil (one of the arrows along y) in units of incident light
                            wavelength.
    @param trefoil2         Trefoil (one of the arrows along x) in units of incident light
                            wavelength.

    @param obscuration      Linear dimension of central obscuration as fraction of pupil linear
                            dimension, [0., 1.).
    @param interpolant      Either an Interpolant2d (or Interpolant) instance or a string indicating
                            which interpolant should be used.  Options are 'nearest', 'sinc', 
                            'linear', 'cubic', 'quintic', or 'lanczosN' where N should be the 
                            integer order to use. [default `interpolant = galsim.Quintic()`]
    @param oversampling     Optional oversampling factor for the InterpolatedImage. Setting 
                            oversampling < 1 will produce aliasing in the PSF (not good).
                            [default `oversampling = 1.`]
    @param pad_factor       Additional multiple by which to zero-pad the PSF image to avoid folding
                            compared to what would be employed for a simple galsim.Airy 
                            [default `pad_factor = 1.5`].  Note that `pad_factor` may need to be 
                            increased for stronger aberrations, i.e. those larger than order unity.
    @param suppress_warning If pad_factor is too small, the code will emit a warning telling you
                            its best guess about how high you might want to raise it.  However,
                            you can suppress this warning by using suppress_warning=True.
                            [default `suppress_warning = False`]
    @param flux             Total flux of the profile [default `flux=1.`].

    @param strut_thick      Thickness of support struts as a fraction of pupil diameter
                            [default `strut_thick = 0.05`]
    @param strut_angle      Angle made between the vertical and the strut starting closest to it,
                            defined to be positive in the counter-clockwise direction; must be a
                            galsim.Angle instance [default `strut_angle = 0. * galsim.degrees`].
    @param gsparams         You may also specify a gsparams argument.  See the docstring for
                            galsim.GSParams using help(galsim.GSParams) for more information about
