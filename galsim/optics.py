"""@file optics.py
Module containing the optical PSF generation routines.

Most of the contents of this file are just functions; they are used to generate galsim.OpticalPSF()
class instances (one of the GSObjects, also in this file).

Most methods in this file (except for the OpticalPSF class itself) are solely of use to developers
for generating arrays that may be useful in defining GSObjects with an optical component.  They will
not therefore be used in a typical image simulation workflow: users will find most of what they need
simply using the OpticalPSF class.

Glossary of key terms used in function names:

PSF = point spread function

OTF = optical transfer function = FT{PSF}

MTF = modulation transfer function = |FT{PSF}|

PTF = phase transfer function = p, where OTF = MTF * exp(i * p)

Wavefront = the amplitude and phase of the incident light on the telescope pupil, encoded as a
complex number. The OTF is the autocorrelation function of the wavefront.

class OpticalPSF(GSObject):
    """A class describing aberrated PSFs due to telescope optics.  Its underlying implementation
    uses an InterpolatedImage to characterize the profile.

    The diffraction effects are characterized by the diffraction angle, which is a function of the
    ratio lambda / D, where lambda is the wavelength of the light and D is the diameter of the
    telescope.  Users can specify this diffraction angle in one of two ways.  The first option is to
    specify the ratio as `lam_over_diam` in whatever arbitrary units they choose (and then
    self-consistently specify the image scale in the same units).  The second option is to specify
    the wavelength as `lam` in units of nanometers and the telescope diameter as `diam` in units of
    meters.  OpticalPSF will then convert the ratio to units of `scale_units`, and image scales must
    be specified in `scale_units` as well.

    Input aberration coefficients are assumed to be supplied in units of wavelength, and correspond
    to the Zernike polynomials in the Noll convention defined in
    Noll, J. Opt. Soc. Am. 66, 207-211(1976).  For a brief summary of the polynomials, refer to
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zernike_polynomials#Zernike_polynomials.

    There are two ways to specify the geometry of the pupil plane, i.e., the obscuration disk size
    and the areas that will be illuminated outside of it.  The first way is to use keywords that
    specify the size of the obscuration, and the nature of the support struts holding up the
    secondary mirror (or prime focus cage, etc.).  These are taken to be rectangular obscurations
    extending from the outer edge of the pupil to the outer edge of the obscuration disk (or the
    pupil center if `obscuration = 0.`).  You can specify how many struts there are (evenly spaced
    in angle), how thick they are as a fraction of the pupil diameter, and what angle they start at
    relative to the positive y direction.

    The second way to specify the pupil plane configuration is by passing in an image of it.  This
    can be useful for example if the struts are not evenly spaced or are not radially directed, as
    is assumed by the simple model for struts described above.  In this case, keywords related to
    struts are ignored; moreover, the `obscuration` keyword is used to ensure that the images are
    properly sampled (so it is still needed), but the keyword is then ignored when using the
    supplied image of the pupil plane.  The `pupil_plane_im` that is passed in can be rotated during
    internal calculations by specifying a `pupil_angle` keyword.  Also note that given how the
    `obscuration` keyword is used, the obscuration in the supplied pupil plane image should indeed
    be reasonably circular rather than having an arbitrary shape; however, minor deviations from a
    perfect circle do not cause significant problems.

    If you choose to pass in a pupil plane image, it must be a square array in which the image of
    the pupil is centered.  The areas that are illuminated should have some value >0, and the other
    areas should have a value of precisely zero.  Based on what the OpticalPSF class thinks is the
    required sampling to make the PSF image, the image that is passed in of the pupil plane might be
    zero-padded during internal calculations.  If the pupil plane image has a scale associated with
    it, that scale will be completely ignored; the scale is determined internally using basic
    physical considerations.  Finally, to ensure accuracy of calculations using a pupil plane image,
    we recommend sampling it as finely as possible.

    Initialization
    --------------

    Either specify the lam/diam ratio directly in arbitrary units:
    
        >>> optical_psf = galsim.OpticalPSF(lam_over_diam=lam_over_diam, defocus=0., astig1=0., 
                                            astig2=0., coma1=0., coma2=0., trefoil1=0., trefoil2=0.,
                                            spher=0., aberrations=None, circular_pupil=True,
                                            obscuration=0., interpolant=None, oversampling=1.5,
                                            pad_factor=1.5, max_size=None, nstruts=0,
                                            strut_thick=0.05, strut_angle=0.*galsim.degrees,
                                            pupil_plane_im=None, pupil_angle=0.*galsim.degrees)

    or, use separate keywords for the telescope diameter and wavelength in meters and nanometers,
    respectively:

        >>> optical_psf = galsim.OpticalPSF(lam=lam, diam=diam, defocus=0., ...)

    Either of these options initializes `optical_psf` as an OpticalPSF instance.

    @param lam_over_diam    Lambda / telescope diameter in the physical units adopted for `scale`
                            (user responsible for consistency).  Either `lam_over_diam`, or `lam`
                            and `diam`, must be supplied.
    @param lam              Lambda (wavelength) in units of nanometers.  Must be supplied with
                            `diam`, and in this case, image scales (`scale`) should be specified in
                            units of `scale_unit`.
    @param diam             Telescope diameter in units of meters.  Must be supplied with
                            `lam`, and in this case, image scales (`scale`) should be specified in
                            units of `scale_unit`.
    @param defocus          Defocus in units of incident light wavelength. [default: 0]
    @param astig1           Astigmatism (like e2) in units of incident light wavelength. 
                            [default: 0]
    @param astig2           Astigmatism (like e1) in units of incident light wavelength.
                            [default: 0]
    @param coma1            Coma along y in units of incident light wavelength. [default: 0]
    @param coma2            Coma along x in units of incident light wavelength. [default: 0]
    @param trefoil1         Trefoil (one of the arrows along y) in units of incident light
                            wavelength. [default: 0]
    @param trefoil2         Trefoil (one of the arrows along x) in units of incident light
                            wavelength. [default: 0]
    @param spher            Spherical aberration in units of incident light wavelength.
                            [default: 0]
    @param aberrations      Optional keyword, to pass in a list, tuple, or NumPy array of
                            aberrations in units of incident light wavelength (ordered according to
                            the Noll convention), rather than passing in individual values for each
                            individual aberration.  Currently GalSim supports aberrations from
                            defocus through third-order spherical (`spher`), which are aberrations
                            4-11 in the Noll convention, and hence `aberrations` should be an
                            object of length 12, with the 5th number (index 4) being the defocus,
                            and so on through index 11 corresponding to `spher`.  Orders 1-3
                            (piston, tip, and tilt), while not true optical aberrations, are
                            permitted to be non-zero and will be treated appropriately, while the
                            first number will be ignored. [default: None]
    @param circular_pupil   Adopt a circular pupil?  [default: True]
    @param obscuration      Linear dimension of central obscuration as fraction of pupil linear
                            dimension, [0., 1.). This should be specified even if you are providing
                            a `pupil_plane_im`, since we need an initial value of obscuration to use
                            to figure out the necessary image sampling. [default: 0]
    @param interpolant      Either an Interpolant instance or a string indicating which interpolant
                            should be used.  Options are 'nearest', 'sinc', 'linear', 'cubic',
                            'quintic', or 'lanczosN' where N should be the integer order to use.
                            [default: galsim.Quintic()]
    @param oversampling     Optional oversampling factor for the InterpolatedImage. Setting 
                            `oversampling < 1` will produce aliasing in the PSF (not good).
                            Usually `oversampling` should be somewhat larger than 1.  1.5 is 
                            usually a safe choice.  [default: 1.5]
    @param pad_factor       Additional multiple by which to zero-pad the PSF image to avoid folding
                            compared to what would be employed for a simple Airy.  Note that
                            `pad_factor` may need to be increased for stronger aberrations, i.e.
                            those larger than order unity.  [default: 1.5]  
    @param suppress_warning If `pad_factor` is too small, the code will emit a warning telling you
                            its best guess about how high you might want to raise it.  However,
                            you can suppress this warning by using `suppress_warning=True`.
                            [default: False]
    @param max_size         Set a maximum size of the internal image for the optical PSF profile
                            in arcsec.  Sometimes the code calculates a rather large image size
                            to describe the optical PSF profile.  If you will eventually be 
                            drawing onto a smallish postage stamp, you might want to save some
                            CPU time by setting `max_size` to be the size of your postage stamp.
                            [default: None]
    @param flux             Total flux of the profile. [default: 1.]
    @param nstruts          Number of radial support struts to add to the central obscuration.
                            [default: 0]
    @param strut_thick      Thickness of support struts as a fraction of pupil diameter.
                            [default:`0.05]
    @param strut_angle      Angle made between the vertical and the strut starting closest to it,
                            defined to be positive in the counter-clockwise direction; must be an
                            Angle instance. [default: 0. * galsim.degrees]
    @param pupil_plane_im   The GalSim.Image, NumPy array, or name of file containing the pupil
                            plane image, to be used instead of generating one based on the
                            obscuration and strut parameters.  Note that if the image is saved as
                            unsigned integers, you will get a warning about conversion to floats,
                            which is harmless. [default: None]
    @param pupil_angle      If `pupil_plane_im` is not None, rotation angle for the pupil plane
                            (positive in the counter-clockwise direction).  Must be an Angle
                            instance. [default: 0. * galsim.degrees]
    @param scale_unit       Units used to define the diffraction limit and draw images, if the user
                            has supplied a separate value for `lam` and `diam`.  Should be either a
                            galsim.AngleUnit, or a string that can be used to construct one (e.g.,
                            'arcsec', 'radians', etc.).
                            [default: galsim.arcsec]
    @param gsparams         An optional GSParams argument.  See the docstring for GSParams for
                            details. [default: None]
