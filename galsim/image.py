    The ImageS, ImageI, ImageF and ImageD classes.
    
    Image[SIFD], ImageView[SIFD] and ConstImage[SIFD] are the classes that represent the primary way
    to pass image data between Python and the GalSim C++ library.

    There is a separate Python class for each C++ template instantiation, and these can be accessed
    using numpy types as keys in the Image dict:

        ImageS == Image[numpy.int16]
        ImageI == Image[numpy.int32]
        ImageF == Image[numpy.float32]
        ImageD == Image[numpy.float64]
    
    An Image can be thought of as containing a 2-d, row-contiguous numpy array (which it may share
    with other ImageView objects), an origin point, and a pixel scale (the origin and pixel scale
    are not shared).

    There are several ways to construct an Image:

        Image(ncol, nrow, init_value=0)        # size and initial value - origin @ (1,1)
        Image(bounds=BoundsI(), init_value=0)  # bounding box and initial value

    An Image also has a '.array' attribute that provides a numpy view into the Image's pixels.

    The individual elements in the array attribute are accessed as im.array[y,x], matching the
    standard numpy convention, while the Image class's own accessors are all (x,y).

    The ImageViewS, ImageViewI, ImageViewF and ImageViewD classes.

    ImageView[SIFD] represents a mutable view of an Image.

    There is a separate Python class for each C++ template instantiation, and these can be accessed
    using numpy types as keys in the ImageView dict:
    
        ImageViewS == ImageView[numpy.int16]
        ImageViewI == ImageView[numpy.int32]
        ImageViewF == ImageView[numpy.float32]
        ImageViewD == ImageView[numpy.float64]

    From Python, the only way to explicitly construct an ImageView is

    >>> imv = ImageView(array, xMin=1, yMin=1)       # numpy array and origin

    However, ImageView instances are also the return type of several functions such as

    >>> im.view()
    >>> im.subImage(bounds)
    >>> im[bounds]                                   # (equivalent to the subImage call above)
    >>> galsim.fits.read(...)
    
    The array argument to the constructor must have contiguous values along rows, which should be
    the case for newly-constructed arrays, but may not be true for some views and generally will not
    be true for array transposes.
    
    An ImageView also has a '.array' attribute that provides a numpy array view into the ImageView
    instance's pixels.  Regardless of how the ImageView was constructed, this array and the
    ImageView will point to the same underlying data, and modifying one view will affect any other
    views into the same data.
    
    The individual elements in the array attribute are accessed as im.array[y,x], matching the
    standard numpy convention as used in the array input to the constructor, while the ImageView 
    class's own accessors are all (x,y).
