"""@file psfcorr.py 
Routines for adaptive moment estimation and PSF correction.

This file contains the python interface to C++ routines for estimation of second moments of images,
and for carrying out PSF correction using a variety of algorithms.  The algorithms are described in
Hirata & Seljak (2003; MNRAS, 343, 459), and were tested/characterized using real data in Mandelbaum
et al. (2005; MNRAS, 361, 1287).

The moments that are estimated are "adaptive moments" (see the first paper cited above for details);
that is, they use an elliptical Gaussian weight that is matched to the image of the object being
measured.  The PSF correction includes several algorithms:

- One from Kaiser, Squires, & Broadhurts (1995), "KSB"

- One from Bernstein & Jarvis (2002), "BJ"

- One that represents a modification by Hirata & Seljak (2003) of methods in Bernstein & Jarvis
(2002), "LINEAR"

- One new method from Hirata & Seljak (2003), "REGAUSS"

These are all based on correction of moments, but with different sets of assumptions.  For more
detailed discussion on all of these algorithms, see the relevant papers above.

    Carry out PSF correction using one of the methods of the HSM package (see references in
    docstring for file psfcorr.py) to estimate galaxy shears, correcting for the convolution by the
    PSF.

    This method works from Image inputs rather than galsim.base.GSObject inputs, which provides
    additional flexibility (e.g., it is possible to work from an Image that was read from file and
    corresponds to no particular GSObject), but this also means that users who wish to apply it to
    simple combinations of GSObjects (e.g., a Convolve) must take the additional step of drawing
    their GSObjects into Images.

    Note that the method will fail if the PSF or galaxy are too point-like to easily fit an
    elliptical Gaussian; when running on batches of many galaxies, it may be preferable to set
    `strict=False` and catch errors explicitly, as in the second example below.

    This function has a number of keyword parameters, many of which a typical user will not need to
    change from the default.

    Example usage
    -------------

    Typical application to a single object:

        >>> galaxy = galsim.Gaussian(flux = 1.0, sigma = 1.0)
        >>> galaxy.applyShear(g1=0.05, g2=0.0)  # shears the Gaussian by (0.05, 0) using the 
                                                # |g| = (a - b)/(a + b) definition
        >>> psf = galsim.Kolmogorov(flux = 1.0, fwhm = 0.7)
        >>> pixel = galsim.Pixel(xw = 0.2, yw = 0.2)
        >>> final = galsim.Convolve([galaxy, psf, pixel])
        >>> final_epsf = galsim.Convolve([psf, pixel])
        >>> final_image = final.draw(dx = 0.2)
        >>> final_epsf_image = final_epsf.draw(dx = 0.2)
        >>> result = galsim.EstimateShearHSM(final_image, final_epsf_image)
    
    After running the above code, `result.observed_shape` ["shape" = distortion, the
    (a^2 - b^2)/(a^2 + b^2) definition of ellipticity] is `(0.0876162,1.23478e-17)` and
    `result.corrected_shape` is `(0.0993412,-1.86255e-09)`, compared with the expected
    `(0.09975, 0)` for a perfect PSF correction method.

    The code below gives an example of how one could run this routine on a large batch of galaxies,
    explicitly catching and tracking any failures:

        n_image = 100
        n_fail = 0
        for i=0, range(n_image):
            #...some code defining this_image, this_final_epsf_image...
            result = galsim.EstimateShearHSM(this_image, this_final_epsf_image, strict = False)
            if result.error_message != "":
                n_fail += 1
        print "Number of failures: ", n_fail

    """Measure adaptive moments of an object.

    This method estimates the best-fit elliptical Gaussian to the object (see Hirata & Seljak 2003
    for more discussion of adaptive moments).  This elliptical Gaussian is computed iteratively
    by initially guessing a circular Gaussian that is used as a weight function, computing the
    weighted moments, recomputing the moments using the result of the previous step as the weight
    function, and so on until the moments that are measured are the same as those used for the
    weight function.  FindAdaptiveMom can be used either as a free function, or as a method of the
    ImageViewI(), ImageViewD() etc. classes.

    Like EstimateShearHSM, FindAdaptiveMom works on Image inputs, and fails if the object is small
    compared to the pixel scale.  For more details, see galsim.EstimateShearHSM (for doxygen
    documentation, see galsim.psfcorr.EstimateShearHSM).

    Example usage

    `my_moments.moments_sigma`, which is `|det(M)|^(1/4)` [=`sigma` for a circular Gaussian] and
    `my_moments.observed_shape`, which is a C++ CppShear.  

    Methods of the CppShear class can be used to get the distortion
    `(e1, e2) = (a^2 - b^2)/(a^2 + b^2)`, e.g. `my_moments.observed_shape.getE1()`, or to get the
    shear `g`, the conformal shear `eta`, and so on.
