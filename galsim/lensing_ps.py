    This helper function is used internally by the methods `PowerSpectrum.getShear`,

    quantities (shear and convergence) to observable ones (reduced shear and magnification).
    Users of `PowerSpectrum.buildGrid` outputs can also apply this method directly to the outputs
    in order to get the values of reduced shear and magnification on the output grid.

    Parameters:

class PowerSpectrum(object):
    r"""Class to represent a lensing shear field according to some power spectrum :math:`P(k)`.

    **General considerations**:

    A PowerSpectrum represents some (flat-sky) shear power spectrum, either for gridded points or at
    arbitary positions.  This class is originally initialized with a power spectrum from which we
    would like to generate g1 and g2 (and, optionally, convergence kappa) values.  It generates
    shears on a grid, and if necessary, when `getShear` (or another "get" method) is called, it
    will interpolate to the requested positions.  For detail on how these processes are carried
    out, please see the document in the GalSim repository, ``devel/modules/lensing_engine.pdf``.

    This class generates the shears according to the input power spectrum using a DFT approach,
    which means that we implicitly assume our discrete representation of :math:`P(k)` on a grid is
    one complete cell in an infinite periodic series.  We are making assumptions about what
    :math:`P(k)` is doing outside of our minimum and maximum k range, and those must be kept in
    mind when comparing with theoretical expectations.  Specifically, since the power spectrum is
    realized on only a finite grid it has been been effectively bandpass filtered between a
    minimum and maximum k value in each of the k1, k2 directions.  See the `buildGrid` method for
    more information.

    As a result, the shear generation currently does not include sample variance due to coverage of
    a finite patch.  We explicitly enforce :math:`P(0)=0`, which is true for the full sky in a
    reasonable cosmological model, but it ignores the fact that our little patch of sky might
    reasonably live in some special region with respect to shear correlations.  Our :math:`P(0)=0`
    is essentially setting the integrated power below our minimum k value to zero.  The
    implications of the discrete representation, and the :math:`P(0)=0` choice, are discussed in
    more detail in ``devel/modules/lensing_engine.pdf``.

    The effective shear correlation function for the gridded points will be modified both because of
    the DFT approach to representing shears according to a power spectrum, and because of the power
    cutoff below and above the minimum k values.  The latter effect can be particularly important on
    large scales, so the `buildGrid` method has some keywords that can be used to reduce the
    impact of the minimum k set by the grid extent.  The calculateXi() method can be used to
    calculate the expected shear correlation functions given the minimum and maximum k for some grid
    (but ignoring the discrete vs. continuous Fourier transform effects), for comparison with some
    ideal theoretical correlation function given an infinite k range.

    When interpolating the shears to non-gridded points, the shear correlation function and power
    spectrum are modified; see the `getShear` and other "get" method docstrings for more details.

    **The power spectra to be used**:

    When creating a PowerSpectrum instance, you must specify at least one of the E or B mode power
    spectra, which is normally given as a function :math:`P(k)`.  The typical thing is to just use a lambda
    function in Python (i.e., a function that is not associated with a name); for example, to define
    :math:`P(k)=k^2`, one would use ``lambda k : k**2``.  But the power spectra can also be more complicated
    user-defined functions that take a single argument ``k`` and return the power at that ``k``
    value, or they can be instances of the `LookupTable` class for power spectra that are known at
    particular ``k`` values but for which there is not a simple analytic form.

    Cosmologists often express the power spectra in terms of an expansion in spherical harmonics
    (ell), i.e., the :math:`C_\ell` values.  In the flat-sky limit, we can replace :math:`\ell`
    with :math:`k` and :math:`C_\ell` with :math:`P(k)`.  Thus, :math:`k` and :math:`P(k)` have
    dimensions of inverse angle and angle^2, respectively.  It is quite common for people to plot
    :math:`\ell(\ell+1) C_\ell/2\pi`, a dimensionless quantity; the analogous flat-sky
    quantity is :math:`\Delta^2 = k^2 P(k)/2\pi`.

    By default, the PowerSpectrum object assumes it is getting :math:`P(k)`, but it is possible to
    instead give it :math:`\Delta^2` by setting the optional keyword ``delta2 = True`` in the
    constructor.

    The power functions must return a list/array that is the same size as what they are given, e.g.,
    in the case of no power or constant power, a function that just returns a float would not be
    permitted; it would have to return an array of floats all with the same value.

    It is important to note that the power spectra used to initialize the PowerSpectrum object
    should use the same units for k and :math:`P(k)`, i.e., if k is in inverse radians then
    :math:`P(k)` should be in radians^2 (as is natural for outputs from a cosmological shear power
    spectrum calculator).  However, when we actually draw images, there is a natural scale that
    defines the pitch of the image, which is typically taken to be arcsec.  This definition of a
    specific length scale means that by default we assume all quantities to the PowerSpectrum are
    in arcsec, and those are the units used for internal calculations, but the ``units`` keyword
    can be used to specify different input units for :math:`P(k)` (again, within the constraint
    that k and :math:`P(k)` must be consistent).  If the ``delta2`` keyword is set to specify that
    the input is actually the dimensionless power :math:`\Delta^2`, then the input ``units`` are
    taken to apply only to the k values.

    Parameters:
        e_power_function:   A function or other callable that accepts a NumPy array of abs(k)
                            values, and returns the E-mode power spectrum P_E(abs(k)) in an array of
                            the same shape.  The function should return the power spectrum desired
                            in the E (gradient) mode of the image.
                            It may also be a string that can be converted to a function using
                            ``eval('lambda k : '+e_power_function)``, a `LookupTable`, or
                            ``file_name`` from which to read in a `LookupTable`.  If a ``file_name``
                            is given, the resulting `LookupTable` uses the defaults for the
                            `LookupTable` class, namely spline interpolation in :math:`P(k)`.
                            Users who wish to deviate from those defaults (for example, to
                            interpolate in log(P) and log(k), as might be more natural for
                            power-law functions) should instead read in the file to create a
                            `LookupTable` using the necessary non-default settings. [default: None,
                            which means no E-mode power.]
        b_power_function:   A function or other callable that accepts a NumPy array of abs(k)
                            values, and returns the B-mode power spectrum P_B(abs(k)) in an array of
                            the same shape.  The function should return the power spectrum desired
                            in the B (curl) mode of the image.  See description of
                            ``e_power_function`` for input format options.  [default: None, which
                            means no B-mode power.]
        delta2:             Is the power actually given as dimensionless :math:`\Delta^2`, which
                            requires us to multiply by :math:`2\pi / k^2` to get the shear power
                            :math:`P(k)` in units of angle^2?  [default: False]
        units:              The angular units used for the power spectrum (i.e. the units of
                            k^-1 and sqrt(P)). This should be either an `AngleUnit` instance
                            (e.g. galsim.radians) or a string (e.g. 'radians'). [default: arcsec]

        """Generate a realization of the current power spectrum on the specified grid.

        **Basic functionality**:

        This function will generate a Gaussian random realization of the specified E and B mode
        shear power spectra at a grid of positions, specified by the input parameters
        ``grid_spacing`` (distance between grid points) and ``ngrid`` (number of grid points in
        each direction.)  Units for ``grid_spacing`` and ``center`` can be specified using the
        ``units`` keyword; the default is arcsec, which is how all values are stored internally.
        It automatically computes and stores grids for the shears and convergence.  However, since
        many users are primarily concerned with shape distortion due to shear, the default is to
        return only the shear components; the ``get_convergence`` keyword can be used to also
        return the convergence.

        The quantities that are returned are the theoretical shears and convergences, usually
        denoted gamma and kappa, respectively.  Users who wish to obtain the more
        observationally-relevant reduced shear and magnification (that describe real lensing
        distortions) can either use the `getShear`, `getMagnification`, or `getLensing` methods
        after `buildGrid`, or can use the convenience function `galsim.lensing_ps.theoryToObserved`
        to convert from theoretical to observed quantities.

        **Caveats of the DFT approach**:

        Note that the shears generated using this method correspond to the PowerSpectrum multiplied
        by a sharp bandpass filter, set by the dimensions of the grid.

        The filter sets :math:`P(k) = 0` for::

            abs(k1), abs(k2) < kmin / 2

        and::

            abs(k1), abs(k2) > kmax + kmin / 2

        where::

            kmin = 2. * pi / (ngrid * grid_spacing)
            kmax = pi / grid_spacing

        and where we have adopted the convention that grid points at a given ``k`` represent the
        interval between (k - dk/2) and (k + dk/2) (noting that the grid spacing dk in k space
        is equivalent to ``kmin``).

        It is worth remembering that this bandpass filter will *not* look like a circular annulus
        in 2D ``k`` space, but is rather more like a thick-sided picture frame, having a small
        square central cutout of dimensions ``kmin`` by ``kmin``.  These properties are visible in
        the shears generated by this method.

        If you care about these effects and want to ameliorate their effect, there are two
        optional kwargs you can provide: ``kmin_factor`` and ``kmax_factor``, both of which are 1
        by default.  These should be integers >= 1 that specify some factor smaller or larger
        (for kmin and kmax respectively) you want the code to use for the underlying grid in
        fourier space.  The final shear grid is returned using the specified ``ngrid`` and
        ``grid_spacing`` parameters.  But the intermediate grid in Fourier space will be larger
        by the specified factors.

        Note: These are really just for convenience, since you could easily get the same effect
        by providing different values of ngrid and grid_spacing and then take a subset of them.
        The ``kmin_factor`` and ``kmax_factor`` just handle the scalings appropriately for you.

        Use of ``kmin_factor`` and ``kmax_factor`` should depend on the desired application.  For
        accurate representation of power spectra, one should not change these values from their
        defaults of 1.  Changing them from one means the E- and B-mode power spectra that are input
        will be valid for the larger intermediate grids that get generated in Fourier space, but not
        necessarily for the smaller ones that get returned to the user.  However, for accurate
        representation of cosmological shear correlation functions, use of ``kmin_factor`` larger
        than one can be helpful in getting the shear correlations closer to the ideal theoretical
        ones (see ``devel/module/lensing_engine.pdf`` for details).

        **Aliasing**:

        If the user provides a power spectrum that does not include a cutoff at kmax, then our
        method of generating shears will result in aliasing that will show up in both E- and
        B-modes.  Thus the `buildGrid` method accepts an optional keyword argument called
        ``bandlimit`` that can tell the PowerSpectrum object to cut off power above kmax
        automatically, where the relevant kmax is larger than the grid Nyquist frequency by a factor
        of ``kmax_factor``.  The allowed values for ``bandlimit`` are None (i.e., do nothing),
        ``hard`` (set power to zero above the band limit), or ``soft`` (use an arctan-based
        softening function to make the power go gradually to zero above the band limit).  By
        default, ``bandlimit=hard``.  Use of this keyword does nothing to the internal
        representation of the power spectrum, so if the user calls the `buildGrid` method again,
        they will need to set ``bandlimit`` again (and if their grid setup is different in a way
        that changes ``kmax``, then that's fine).

        **Interpolation**:

        If the grid is being created for the purpose of later interpolating to random positions, the
        following findings should be kept in mind: since the interpolant modifies the effective
        shear correlation function on scales comparable to <~3x the grid spacing, the grid spacing
        should be chosen to be at least 3 times smaller than the minimum scales on which the user
        wishes to reproduce the shear correlation function accurately.  Ideally, the grid should be
        somewhat larger than the region in which shears at random points are needed, so that edge
        effects in the interpolation will not be important.  For this purpose, there should be >~5
        grid points outside of the region in which interpolation will take place.  Ignoring this
        edge effect and using the grid for interpolation out to its edges can suppress shear
        correlations on all scales by an amount that depends on the grid size; for a 100x100 grid,
        the suppression is ~2-3%.  Note that the above numbers came from tests that use a
        cosmological shear power spectrum; precise figures for this suppression can also depend on
        the shear correlation function itself.

        **Sign conventions and other info**:

        Note also that the convention for axis orientation differs from that for the GREAT10
        challenge, so when using codes that deal with GREAT10 challenge outputs, the sign of our g2
        shear component must be flipped.

        For more information on the effects of finite grid representation of the power spectrum

                >>> my_ps = galsim.PowerSpectrum(lambda k : k**2)
                >>> g1, g2 = my_ps.buildGrid(grid_spacing = 1., ngrid = 100)

           The returned g1, g2 are 2-d NumPy arrays of values, corresponding to the values of
           g1 and g2 at the locations of the grid points.

           For a given value of ``grid_spacing`` and ``ngrid``, we could get the x and y values on
           the grid using::

                >>> import numpy as np
                >>> min = (-ngrid/2 + 0.5) * grid_spacing
                >>> max = (ngrid/2 - 0.5) * grid_spacing
                >>> x, y = np.meshgrid(np.arange(min,max+grid_spacing,grid_spacing),
                ...                    np.arange(min,max+grid_spacing,grid_spacing))

           where the center of the grid is taken to be (0,0).

        2. Rebuild the grid using a particular rng and set the location of the center of the grid
           to be something other than the default (0,0)::

                >>> g1, g2 = my_ps.buildGrid(grid_spacing = 8., ngrid = 65,
                ...                          rng = galsim.BaseDeviate(1413231),
                ...                          center = galsim.PositionD(256.5, 256.5) )

        3. Make a `PowerSpectrum` from a tabulated :math:`P(k)` that gets interpolated to find the
           power at all necessary values of k, then generate shears and convergences on a grid, and
           convert to reduced shear and magnification so they can be used to transform galaxy
           images.  E.g., assuming that k and P_k are NumPy arrays containing k and :math:`P(k)`::

                >>> tab_pk = galsim.LookupTable(k, P_k)
                >>> my_ps = galsim.PowerSpectrum(tab_pk)
                >>> g1, g2, kappa = my_ps.buildGrid(grid_spacing = 1., ngrid = 100,
                ...                                 get_convergence = True)
                >>> g1_r, g2_r, mu = galsim.lensing_ps.theoryToObserved(g1, g2, kappa)

        Parameters:
            grid_spacing:       Spacing for an evenly spaced grid of points, by default in arcsec
                                for consistency with the natural length scale of images created
                                using the `GSObject.drawImage` method.  Other units can be
                                specified using the ``units`` keyword.
            ngrid:              Number of grid points in each dimension.  [Must be an integer]
            rng:                A `BaseDeviate` object for drawing the random numbers.
                                [default: None]
            interpolant:        `Interpolant` that will be used for interpolating the gridded shears
                                by methods like `getShear`, `getConvergence`, etc. if they are
                                later called. [default: galsim.Lanczos(5)]
            center:             If setting up a new grid, define what position you want to consider
                                the center of that grid.  Units must be consistent with those for
                                ``grid_spacing``.  [default: galsim.PositionD(0,0)]
            units:              The angular units used for the positions.  [default: arcsec]
            get_convergence:    Return the convergence in addition to the shear?  Regardless of the
                                value of ``get_convergence``, the convergence will still be computed
                                and stored for future use. [default: False]
            kmin_factor:        Factor by which the grid spacing in fourier space is smaller than
                                the default.  i.e.::

                                    kmin = 2. * pi / (ngrid * grid_spacing) / kmin_factor

                                [default: 1; must be an integer]
            kmax_factor:        Factor by which the overall grid in fourier space is larger than
                                the default.  i.e.::

                                    kmax = pi / grid_spacing * kmax_factor

                                [default: 1; must be an integer]
            bandlimit:          Keyword determining how to handle power :math:`P(k)` above the
                                limiting k value, kmax.  The options None, 'hard', and 'soft'
                                correspond to doing nothing (i.e., allow P(>kmax) to be aliased to
                                lower k values), cutting off all power above kmax, and applying a
                                softening filter to gradually cut off power above kmax.  Use of
                                this keyword does not modify the internally-stored power spectrum,
                                just the shears generated for this particular call to `buildGrid`.
                                [default: "hard"]
            variance:           Optionally renormalize the variance of the output shears to a
                                given value.  This is useful if you know the functional form of
                                the power spectrum you want, but not the normalization.  This lets
                                you set the normalization separately.  The resulting shears should
                                have var(g1) + var(g2) ~= variance.  If only ``e_power_function`` is
                                given, then this is also the variance of kappa.  Otherwise, the
                                variance of kappa may be smaller than the specified variance.
                                [default: None]

        Returns:
            the tuple (g1,g2[,kappa]), where each is a 2-d NumPy array and kappa is included
            iff ``get_convergence`` is set to True.

        r"""Calculate shear correlation functions for the current power spectrum on the specified
        grid.

        This function will calculate the theoretical shear correlation functions, :math:`\xi_+`
        and :math:`\xi_-`, for this power spectrum and the grid configuration specified using
        keyword arguments, taking into account the minimum and maximum k range implied by the grid
        parameters, ``kmin_factor`` and ``kmax_factor``.  Most theoretical correlation function
        calculators assume an infinite k range, so this utility can be used to check how close the
        chosen grid parameters (and the implied minimum and maximum k) come to the "ideal" result.
        This is particularly useful on large scales, since in practice the finite grid extent
        limits the minimum k value and therefore can suppress shear correlations on large scales.
        Note that the actual shear correlation function in the generated shears will still differ
        from the one calculated here due to differences between the discrete and continuous Fourier
        transform.

        The quantities that are returned are three NumPy arrays: separation theta (in the adopted
        units), :math:`\xi_+`, and :math:`\xi_-`.  These are defined in terms of the E- and B-mode
        shear power spectrum as in the document ``devel/modules/lensing_engine.pdf``, equations 2
        and 3.  The values that are returned are for a particular theta value, not an average over
        a range of theta values in some bin of finite width.

        This method has been tested with cosmological shear power spectra; users should check for
        sanity of outputs if attempting to use power spectra that have very different scalings with
        k.

            n_theta:        (Optional) Number of logarithmically spaced bins in angular
                            separation. [default ``n_theta=100``]
            bandlimit:      (Optional) Keyword determining how to handle power :math:`P(k)` above
                            the limiting k value, kmax.  The options None, 'hard', and 'soft'
                            correspond to doing nothing (i.e., allow P(>kmax) to be aliased to

                            softening filter to gradually cut off power above kmax.  Use of this
                            keyword does not modify the internally-stored power spectrum, just

        """
        This function can interpolate between grid positions to find the shear values for a given
        list of input positions (or just a single position).  Before calling this function, you must
        call `buildGrid` first to define the grid of shears and convergences on which to
        interpolate.  The docstring for `buildGrid` provides some guidance on appropriate grid
        configurations to use when building a grid that is to be later interpolated to random
        positions.

        By default, this method returns the reduced shear, which is defined in terms of shear and
        convergence as reduced shear ``g=gamma/(1-kappa)``; the ``reduced`` keyword can be set to
        False in order to return the non-reduced shear.

        Note that the interpolation (specified when calling `buildGrid`) modifies the effective
        shear power spectrum and correlation function somewhat, though the effects can be limited
        by careful choice of grid parameters (see buildGrid() docstring for details).  Assuming
        those guidelines are followed, then the shear correlation function modifications due to use
        of the quintic, Lanczos-3, and Lanczos-5 interpolants are below 5% on all scales from the
        grid spacing to the total grid extent, typically below 2%.  The linear, cubic, and nearest
        interpolants perform significantly more poorly, with modifications of the correlation
        functions that can reach tens of percent on the scales where the recommended interpolants
        perform well.  Thus, the default interpolant is Lanczos-5, and users should think carefully
        about the acceptability of significant modification of the shear correlation function before
        changing to use linear, cubic, or nearest.

        Users who wish to ensure that the shear power spectrum is preserved post-interpolation
        should consider using the ``periodic`` interpolation option, which assumes the shear field
        is periodic (i.e., the sky is tiled with many copies of the given shear field).  Those who
        care about the correlation function should not use this option, and for this reason it's
        not the default.

        **Examples**:

        1. Get the shear for a particular point::

                >>> g1, g2 = my_ps.getShear(pos = galsim.PositionD(12, 412))

           This time the returned values are just floats and correspond to the shear for the
           provided position.

        2. You can also provide a position as a tuple to save the explicit PositionD construction::

                >>> g1, g2 = my_ps.getShear(pos = (12, 412))

        3. Get the shears for a bunch of points at once::

                >>> xlist = [ 141, 313,  12, 241, 342 ]
                >>> ylist = [  75, 199, 306, 225, 489 ]
                >>> poslist = [ galsim.PositionD(xlist[i],ylist[i]) for i in range(len(xlist)) ]
                >>> g1, g2 = my_ps.getShear( poslist )
                >>> g1, g2 = my_ps.getShear( (xlist, ylist) )

           Both calls do the same thing.  The returned g1, g2 this time are numpy arrays of g1, g2
           values.  The arrays are the same length as the number of input positions.

        Parameters:
            pos:            Position(s) of the source(s), assumed to be post-lensing!

    sets up the grids in k-space and computes the power on them.  It also computes spin weighting
    terms.  You can alter any of the setup properties later.  It currently only works for square
    grids (at least, much of the internals would be incorrect for non-square grids), so while it
    nominally contains arrays that could be allowed to be non-square, the constructor itself
    enforces squareness.

    This function takes gridded shears and constructs a convergence map from them.  While this is
    complicated in reality by the non-gridded galaxy positions, it is a straightforward
    implementation using Fourier transforms for the case of gridded galaxy positions.  Note that
    there are additional complications when dealing with real observational issues like shape noise
    that are not handled by this function, and likewise there are known edge effects.

    Note that, like any process that attempts to recover information from discretely sampled data,
    the ``kappa_E`` and ``kappa_B`` maps returned by this function are subject to aliasing.
    There will be distortions if there are non-zero frequency modes in the lensing field represented
    by ``g1`` and ``g2`` at more than half the frequency represented by the ``g1``, ``g2`` grid
    spacing.  To avoid this issue in practice you can smooth the input ``g1``, ``g2`` to effectively
    bandlimit them (the same smoothing kernel will be present in the output ``kappa_E``,
    ``kappa_B``).  If applying this function to shears drawn randomly according to some power
    spectrum, the power spectrum that is used should be modified to go to zero above the relevant
    maximum k value for the grid being used.

    Parameters:
        g1:     Square NumPy array containing the first component of shear.
        g2:     Square NumPy array containing the second component of shear.

    Returns:
