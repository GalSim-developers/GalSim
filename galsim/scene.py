class COSMOSCatalog(object):
    """
    A class representing a sample of galaxies from the COSMOS sample with F814W<23.5.

    Depending on the keyword arguments, particularly `use_real`, the catalog will either have
    information about real galaxies, or parametric ones.  To use this with either type of galaxies,
    you need to get the COSMOS datasets in the format that GalSim recognizes; see

        https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim/wiki/RealGalaxy-Data

    option (1) for more information.  Note that if you want to make real galaxies you need to
    download and store the full tarball with all galaxy images, whereas if you want to make
    parametric galaxies you only need the catalog real_galaxy_catalog_23.5_fits.fits and can delete
    the other files.

    Finally, we provide a program that will download the large COSMOS sample for you and
    put it in the $PREFIX/share/galsim directory of your installation path.  The program is

            galsim_download_cosmos

    which gets installed in the $PREFIX/bin directory when you install GalSim.  If you use
    this program to download the COSMOS catalog, then you can use it with

            cat = galsim.COSMOSCatalog()

    GalSim knows the location of the installation share directory, so it will automatically
    look for it there.

    After getting the catalogs, there is a method makeGalaxy() that can make a GSObject
    corresponding to any chosen galaxy in the catalog (whether real or parametric).  See
    help(galsim.COSMOSCatalog.makeGalaxy) for more information.  As an interesting application and
    example of the usage of these routines, consider the following code:

        >>> im_size = 64
        >>> pix_scale = 0.05
        >>> bp_file = os.path.join(galsim.meta_data.share_dir, 'wfc_F814W.dat.gz')
        >>> bandpass = galsim.Bandpass(bp_file, wave_type='ang').thin().withZeropoint(25.94)
        >>> cosmos_cat = galsim.COSMOSCatalog()
        >>> psf = galsim.OpticalPSF(diam=2.4, lam=1000.) # bigger than HST F814W PSF.
        >>> indices = np.arange(10)
        >>> real_gal_list = cosmos_cat.makeGalaxy(indices, gal_type='real',
        ...                                       noise_pad_size=im_size*pix_scale)
        >>> param_gal_list = cosmosm_cat.makeGalaxy(indices, gal_type='parametric', chromatic=True)
        >>> for ind in indices:
        >>>     real_gal = galsim.Convolve(real_gal_list[ind], psf)
        >>>     param_gal = galsim.Convolve(param_gal_list[ind], psf)
        >>>     im_real = galsim.Image(im_size, im_size)
        >>>     im_param = galsim.Image(im_size, im_size)
        >>>     real_gal.drawImage(image=im_real, scale=pix_scale)
        >>>     param_gal.drawImage(bandpass, image=im_param, scale=pix_scale)
        >>>     im_real.write('im_real_'+str(ind)+'.fits')
        >>>     im_param.write('im_param_'+str(ind)+'.fits')

    This code snippet will draw images of the first 10 entries in the COSMOS catalog, at slightly
    lower resolution than in COSMOS, with a real image and its parametric representation for each of
    those objects.  Note that we are automatically excluding galaxies that do not have parametric
    representations.  These are rare and do not occur in the first ten entries in the catalog, which
    is why we can assume that the real and parametric objects will be comparable.

    Initialization
    --------------

    @param file_name    The file containing the catalog. [default: None, which will look for the
                        COSMOS catalog in $PREFIX/share/galsim.  It will raise an exception if the
                        catalog is not there telling you to run galsim_download_cosmos.]
    @param image_dir    Keyword that is only used for real galaxies, not parametric ones, to specify
                        the directory of the image files.
                        If a string containing no `/`, it is the relative path from the location of
                        the catalog file to the directory containing the galaxy/PDF images.
                        If a path (a string containing `/`), it is the full path to the directory
                        containing the galaxy/PDF images. [default: None]
    @param dir          The directory of catalog file. [default: None]
    @param preload      Keyword that is only used for real galaxies, not parametric ones, to choose
                        whether to preload the header information.  If `preload=True`, the bulk of  
                        the I/O time is in the constructor.  If `preload=False`, there is
                        approximately the same total I/O time (assuming you eventually use most of
                        the image files referenced in the catalog), but it is spread over the
                        various calls to getGal() and getPSF().  [default: False]
    @param noise_dir    Keyword that is only used for real galaxies, not parametric ones.
                        The directory of the noise files if different from the directory of the 
                        image files.  [default: image_dir]
    @param use_real     Enable the use of realistic galaxies?  [default: True]
                        If this parameter is False, then `makeGalaxy(gal_type='real')` will
                        not be allowed.
    @param exclude_fail Exclude galaxies that have failures in the parametric fits? [default: True]
    @param exclude_bad  Exclude those that have evidence of probably being a bad fit?  e.g. n > 5
                        and hlr > 1 arcsec, probably indicates poor sky subtraction. [default: True]
    @param max_hlr      Exclude galaxies whose fitted half-light-radius is larger than this value
                        (in arcsec).  [default: 0, meaning no limit]

        """
        Routine to construct GSObjects corresponding to the catalog entry with a particular index 
        or indices.

        The flux of the galaxy corresponds to a 1 second exposure time with the Hubble Space
        Telescope.  Users who wish to simulate F814W images with a different telescope and an
        exposure time longer than 1 second should multiply by that exposure time, and by the square
        of the ratio of the effective diameter of their telescope compared to that of HST.
        (Effective diameter may differ from the actual diameter if there is significant
        obscuration.)  See demo11.py for an example that explicitly takes this normalization into
        account.

        Due to the adopted flux normalization, drawing into an image with the COSMOS bandpass,
        zeropoint of 25.94, and pixel scale should give the right pixel values to mimic the actual
        COSMOS science images.  The COSMOS science images that we use are normalized to a count rate
        of 1 second, which is why there is no need to rescale to account for the COSMOS exposure
        time.

        There is an option to make chromatic objects (`chromatic=True`); however, it is important
        to bear in mind that we do not actually have spatially-resolved color information for these
        galaxies, so this keyword can only be True if we are using parametric galaxies.  Even then,
        we simply do the most arbitrary thing possible, which is to assign bulges an elliptical
        SED, disks a disk-like SED, and Sersic galaxies with intermediate values of n some
        intermediate SED.  We assume that the photometric redshift is the correct redshift for
        these galaxies (which is a good assumption for COSMOS 30-band photo-z for these bright
        galaxies).  For the given SED and redshift, we then normalize to give the right (observed)
        flux in F814W.  Note that for a mock "deep" sample, the redshift distributions of the
        galaxies would be modified, which is not included here.

        For this chromatic option, it is still the case that the output flux normalization is
        appropriate for the HST effective telescope diameter and a 1 second exposure time, so users
        who are simulating another scenario should account for this.

        @param index            Index of the desired galaxy in the catalog for which a GSObject
                                should be constructed.  You may also provide a list or array of
                                indices, in which case a list of objects is returned. If None,
                                then a single galaxy is chosen at random.  [default: None]

                                then this defaults to 'parametric', and in fact 'real' is 
                                not allowed.]
        @param chromatic        Make this a chromatic object, or not?  [default: False]
        @param noise_pad_size   For realistic galaxies, the size of region to pad with noise,
                                in arcsec.  [default: 5, an arbitrary, but not completely
                                ridiculous choice.]
        @param deep             Modify fluxes and sizes of galaxies in order to roughly simulate
                                an F814W<25 sample? [default: False]
        @param rng              A random number generator to use for selecting a random galaxy
                                (may be any kind of BaseDeviate or None) and to use in generating
                                any noise field when padding.  [default: None]
        @param gsparams         An optional GSParams argument.  See the docstring for GSParams for
                                details. [default: None]
