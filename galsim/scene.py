class COSMOSCatalog(object):
    """
    A class representing a random subsample of galaxies from the COSMOS sample with F814W<25.2
    (default), or alternatively the entire sample with F814W<23.5.

    Depending on the keyword arguments, particularly ``use_real``, the catalog will either have
    information about real galaxies, and/or parametric ones.  To use this with either type of
    galaxies, you need to get the COSMOS datasets in the format that GalSim recognizes; see

    https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim/wiki/RealGalaxy-Data

    option (1) for more information.  Note that if you want to make real galaxies you need to
    download and store the full tarball with all galaxy images, whereas if you want to make
    parametric galaxies you only need the catalog real_galaxy_catalog_25.2_fits.fits (and the
    selection file real_galaxy_catalog_25.2_selection.fits if you want to place cuts on the
    postage stamp quality) and can delete the galaxy and PSF image files.

    Finally, we provide a program that will download the large COSMOS sample for you and
    put it in the $PREFIX/share/galsim directory of your installation path.  The program is::

            galsim_download_cosmos

    which gets installed in the $PREFIX/bin directory when you install GalSim.  If you use
    this program to download the COSMOS catalog, then you can use it with::

            cat = galsim.COSMOSCatalog()

    GalSim knows the location of the installation share directory, so it will automatically
    look for it there.

    In addition to the option of specifying catalog names, this class also accepts a keyword
    argument ``sample`` that can be used to switch between the samples with limiting magnitudes of
    23.5 and 25.2.

    After getting the catalogs, there is a method makeGalaxy() that can make a `GSObject`
    corresponding to any chosen galaxy in the catalog (whether real or parametric).  See
    `makeGalaxy` for more information.  As an interesting application and example of the usage of
    these routines, consider the following code::

        >>> im_size = 64
        >>> pix_scale = 0.05
        >>> bp_file = os.path.join(galsim.meta_data.share_dir, 'wfc_F814W.dat.gz')
        >>> bandpass = galsim.Bandpass(bp_file, wave_type='ang').thin().withZeropoint(25.94)
        >>> cosmos_cat = galsim.COSMOSCatalog()
        >>> psf = galsim.OpticalPSF(diam=2.4, lam=1000.) # bigger than HST F814W PSF.
        >>> indices = np.arange(10)
        >>> real_gal_list = cosmos_cat.makeGalaxy(indices, gal_type='real',
        ...                                       noise_pad_size=im_size*pix_scale)
        >>> param_gal_list = cosmos_cat.makeGalaxy(indices, gal_type='parametric', chromatic=True)
        >>> for ind in indices:
        >>>     real_gal = galsim.Convolve(real_gal_list[ind], psf)
        >>>     param_gal = galsim.Convolve(param_gal_list[ind], psf)
        >>>     im_real = galsim.Image(im_size, im_size)
        >>>     im_param = galsim.Image(im_size, im_size)
        >>>     real_gal.drawImage(image=im_real, scale=pix_scale)
        >>>     param_gal.drawImage(bandpass, image=im_param, scale=pix_scale)
        >>>     im_real.write('im_real_'+str(ind)+'.fits')
        >>>     im_param.write('im_param_'+str(ind)+'.fits')

    This code snippet will draw images of the first 10 entries in the COSMOS catalog, at slightly
    lower resolution than in COSMOS, with a real image and its parametric representation for each of
    those objects.

    When using the 'real' rather than 'parametric' option, please read the documentation for the
    `RealGalaxy` class for additional caveats about the available drawing methods and
    the need to convolve with a suitable PSF.

    Parameters:
        file_name:          The file containing the catalog. [default: None, which will look for the
                            F814W<25.2 COSMOS catalog in $PREFIX/share/galsim.  It will raise an
                            exception if the catalog is not there telling you to run
                            galsim_download_cosmos.]
        sample:             A keyword argument that can be used to specify the sample to use, i.e.,
                            "23.5" or "25.2".  At most one of ``file_name`` and ``sample`` should be
                            specified.  [default: None, which results in the same default as
                            ``file_name=None``.]
        dir:                The directory with the catalog file and, if making realistic galaxies,
                            the image and noise files (or symlinks to them). [default: None, which
                            will look in $PREFIX/share/galsim.]
        preload:            Keyword that is only used for real galaxies, not parametric ones, to
                            choose whether to preload the header information.  If ``preload=True``,
                            the bulk of the I/O time is in the constructor.  If ``preload=False``,
                            there is approximately the same total I/O time (assuming you eventually
                            use most of the image files referenced in the catalog), but it is spread
                            over the calls to makeGalaxy().  [default: False]
        use_real:           Enable the use of realistic galaxies?  [default: True]
                            If this parameter is False, then ``makeGalaxy(gal_type='real')`` will
                            not be allowed, and there will be a (modest) decrease in RAM and time
                            spent on I/O when initializing the COSMOSCatalog. If the real
                            catalog is not available for some reason, it will still be possible to
                            make parametric images.
        exclusion_level:    Level of additional cuts to make on the galaxies based on the quality
                            of postage stamp definition and/or parametric fit quality [beyond the
                            minimal cuts imposed when making the catalog - see Mandelbaum et
                            al. (2012, MNRAS, 420, 1518) for details].  Options:

                            - "none": No cuts.
                            - "bad_stamp": Apply cuts to eliminate galaxies that have failures in
                              postage stamp definition.  These cuts may also eliminate a small
                              subset of the good postage stamps as well.
                            - "bad_fits": Apply cuts to eliminate galaxies that have failures in the
                              parametric fits.  These cuts may also eliminate a small
                              subset of the good parametric fits as well.
                            - "marginal": Apply the above cuts, plus ones that eliminate some more
                              marginal cases.

                            [default: "marginal"]
        min_hlr:            Exclude galaxies whose fitted half-light radius is smaller than this
                            value (in arcsec).  [default: 0, meaning no limit]
        max_hlr:            Exclude galaxies whose fitted half-light radius is larger than this
                            value (in arcsec).  [default: 0, meaning no limit]
        min_flux:           Exclude galaxies whose fitted flux is smaller than this value.
                            [default: 0, meaning no limit]
        max_flux:           Exclude galaxies whose fitted flux is larger than this value.
                            [default: 0, meaning no limit]
        exptime:            The exposure time (in seconds) to assume when creating galaxies.
                            .. note::

                                The processed COSMOS ACS/HST science images have units of
                                counts/second; i.e. they have an effective exposure time of 1
                                second in terms of their flux levels. The default value
                                corresponds to a 1 second exposure on HST, which will match
                                these processed images.

                            [default: 1]
        area:               The effective collecting area (in cm^2) to assume when creating
                            galaxies. [default: None, which means to use the original HST
                            collecting area = pi/4 * 240**2 * (1.-0.33**2)]

        """
        Routine to construct one or more `GSObject` instances corresponding to the catalog entry
        with a particular index or indices.

        The flux of the galaxy corresponds to a 1 second exposure time with the Hubble Space
        Telescope.  Users who wish to simulate F814W images with a different telescope and an
        exposure time longer than 1 second should multiply by that exposure time, and by the square
        of the ratio of the effective diameter of their telescope compared to that of HST.
        (Effective diameter may differ from the actual diameter if there is significant
        obscuration.)  See demo11.py for an example that explicitly takes this normalization into
        account.

        Due to the adopted flux normalization, drawing into an image with the COSMOS bandpass,
        zeropoint of 25.94, and pixel scale should give the right pixel values to mimic the actual
        COSMOS science images.  The COSMOS science images that we use are normalized to a count rate
        of 1 second, which is why there is no need to rescale to account for the COSMOS exposure
        time.

        There is an option to make chromatic objects (``chromatic=True``); however, it is important
        to bear in mind that we do not actually have spatially-resolved color information for these
        galaxies, so this keyword can only be True if we are using parametric galaxies.  Even then,
        we simply do the most arbitrary thing possible, which is to assign bulges an elliptical
        `SED`, disks a disk-like `SED`, and `Sersic` galaxies with intermediate values of n some
        intermediate `SED`.  We assume that the photometric redshift is the correct redshift for
        these galaxies (which is a good assumption for COSMOS 30-band photo-z for these bright
        galaxies).  For the given `SED` and redshift, we then normalize to give the right (observed)
        flux in F814W.  Note that for a mock "deep" sample, the redshift distributions of the
        galaxies would be modified, which is not included here.

        For this chromatic option, it is still the case that the output flux normalization is
        appropriate for the HST effective telescope diameter and a 1 second exposure time, so users
        who are simulating another scenario should account for this.

        Note that the returned objects use arcsec for the units of their linear dimension.  If you
        are using a different unit for other things (the PSF, WCS, etc.), then you should dilate
        the resulting object with ``gal.dilate(galsim.arcsec / scale_unit)``.

        Parameters:
            index:          Index of the desired galaxy in the catalog for which a `GSObject`
                            should be constructed.  You may also provide a list or array of
                            indices, in which case a list of objects is returned. If None,
                            then a random galaxy (or more: see n_random kwarg) is chosen,
                            correcting for catalog-level selection effects if weights are
                            available. [default: None]
            gal_type:       Either 'real' or 'parametric'.  This determines which kind of
                            galaxy model is made. [If catalog was loaded with ``use_real=False``,
                            then this defaults to 'parametric', and in fact 'real' is
                            not allowed.  If catalog was loaded with ``use_real=True``, then
                            this defaults to 'real'.]
            chromatic:      Make this a chromatic object, or not?  [default: False]
            noise_pad_size: For realistic galaxies, the size of region to pad with noise,
                            in arcsec.  [default: 5, an arbitrary, but not completely
                            ridiculous choice.]
            deep:           Modify fluxes and sizes of galaxies from the F814W<23.5 sample in
                            order to roughly simulate an F814W<25 sample but with higher S/N, as
                            in GREAT3? [default: False]  Note that this keyword will be ignored
                            (except for issuing a warning) if the input catalog already
                            represents the F814W<25.2 sample.
            sersic_prec:    The desired precision on the Sersic index n in parametric galaxies.
                            GalSim is significantly faster if it gets a smallish number of
                            Sersic values, so it can cache some of the calculations and use
                            them again the next time it gets a galaxy with the same index.
                            If ``sersic_prec`` is 0.0, then use the exact value of index n from
                            the catalog.  But if it is >0, then round the index to that
                            precision.  [default: 0.05]
            rng:            A random number generator to use for selecting a random galaxy
                            (may be any kind of `BaseDeviate` or None) and to use in generating
                            any noise field when padding.  [default: None]
            n_random:       The number of random galaxies to build, if 'index' is None.
                            [default: 1]
            gsparams:       An optional `GSParams` argument. [default: None]

        Returns:
            Either a `GSObject` or a `ChromaticObject` depending on the value of ``chromatic``,
            or a list of them if ``index`` is an iterable.
