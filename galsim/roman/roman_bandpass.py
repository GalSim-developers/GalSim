def getBandpasses(AB_zeropoint=True, default_thin_trunc=True, include_all_bands=False, **kwargs):
    """Utility to get a dictionary containing the Roman ST bandpasses used for imaging.

    This routine reads in a file containing a list of wavelengths and throughput for all Roman
    bandpasses, and uses the information in the file to create a dictionary. This file is in units
    of effective area (m^2), which includes the nominal mirror size and obscuration in each
    bandpass.  We divide these by the nominal roman.collecting_area, so the bandpass objects
    include both filter transmission losses and the obscuration differences relevant for
    each bandpass.  I.e. you should always use roman.collecting_area for the collecting area
    in any flux calculation, and the bandpass will account for the differences from this.

    In principle it should be possible to replace the version of the file with another one, provided
    that the format obeys the following rules:

    - There is a column called 'Wave', containing the wavelengths in microns.
    - The other columns are labeled by the name of the bandpass.

    The bandpasses can be either truncated or thinned before setting the zero points, by passing in
    the keyword arguments that need to get propagated through to the Bandpass.thin() and/or
    Bandpass.truncate() routines.  Or, if the user wishes to thin and truncate using the defaults
    for those two routines, they can use ``default_thin_trunc=True``.  This option is the default,
    because the stored 'official' versions of the bandpasses cover a wide wavelength range.  So even
    if thinning is not desired, truncation is recommended.

    By default, the routine will set an AB zeropoint (unless ``AB_zeropoint=False``).  The
    zeropoint in GalSim is defined such that the flux is 1 photon/cm^2/sec through the
    bandpass. This differs from an instrumental bandpass, which is typically defined such that the
    flux is 1 photon/sec for that instrument.  The difference between the two can be calculated as
    follows::

        # Shift zeropoint based on effective collecting area in cm^2.
        delta_zp = 2.5 * np.log10(galsim.roman.collecting_area)

    ``delta_zp`` will be a positive number that should be added to the GalSim zeropoints to compare
    with externally calculated instrumental zeropoints.  When using the GalSim zeropoints for
    normalization of fluxes, the ``area`` kwarg to drawImage can be used to get the right
    normalization (giving it the quantity ``galsim.roman.collecting_area``).

    This routine also loads information about sky backgrounds in each filter, to be used by the
    galsim.roman.getSkyLevel() routine.  The sky background information is saved as an attribute in
    each Bandpass object.

    There are some subtle points related to the filter edges, which seem to depend on the field
    angle at some level.  This is more important for the grism than for the imaging, so currently
    this effect is not included in the Roman bandpasses in GalSim.

    The bandpass throughput file is translated from a spreadsheet Roman_effarea_20201130.xlsx at
    https://roman.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/WFI_technical.html.

    Example::

        >>> roman_bandpasses = galsim.roman.getBandpasses()
        >>> f184_bp = roman_bandpasses['F184']

    Parameters:
        AB_zeropoint:       Should the routine set an AB zeropoint before returning the bandpass?
                            If False, then it is up to the user to set a zero point.  [default:
                            True]
        default_thin_trunc: Use the default thinning and truncation options?  Users who wish to
                            use no thinning and truncation of bandpasses, or who want control over
                            the level of thinning and truncation, should have this be False.
                            [default: True]
        include_all_bands:  Should the routine include the non-imaging bands (e.g., grisms)?
                            This does not implement any dispersion physics by itself.
                            There is currently no estimate for the thermal background for these
                            bands and they are set to zero arbitrarily.
                            [default: False]
        **kwargs:           Other kwargs are passed to either `Bandpass.thin` or
                            `Bandpass.truncate` as appropriate.

    @returns A dictionary containing bandpasses for all Roman imaging filters.
