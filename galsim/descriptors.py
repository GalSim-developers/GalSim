class SimpleParam(object):
    """
    Descriptor that gets/sets a value, and on setting causes the GSObject's stored SBProfile to

    Use it like this:

    class MyProfile(GSObject):

    Initialization
    --------------
    Most of the init params are very obvious in meaning, two of them less so:

    @param update_SBProfile_on_set       Most params, if changed/set, require a later re-
                                         initialization of the SBProfile contained by the object.
                                         If a param does not, for example the flux which can be
                                         efficiently changed on the SBProfile in situ, then this can
                                         be indicated by setting update_SBProfile_on_set = False.
                                         
    @param ok_if_object_transformed      Most params will become outdated/inaccurate for an object
                                         after it undergoes a general affine transformation, and so
                                         the default behaviour is to raise an AttributeError if
                                         trying to get/set params for objects which have undergone
                                         a transformation. Setting ok_if_object_transformed = True
                                         disables this.  Again, this is handy if dealing with flux,
                                         which can still be calculated/changed for transformed

    Use it like this, illustrating a reworking of the GetSetScaleParam functionality to define one
    parameter as a rescaling of the other:
