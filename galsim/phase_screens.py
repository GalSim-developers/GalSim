class AtmosphericScreen:
    """ An atmospheric phase screen that can drift in the wind and evolves ("boils") over time.  The
    initial phases and fractional phase updates are drawn from a von Karman power spectrum, which is
    defined by a Fried parameter that effectively sets the amplitude of the turbulence, and an outer
    scale beyond which the turbulence power flattens.

    AtmosphericScreen delays the actual instantiation of the phase screen array in memory until it
    is used for either drawing a PSF or querying the wavefront or wavefront gradient.  This is to
    facilitate automatic truncation of the screen power spectrum depending on the use case.  For
    example, when drawing a `PhaseScreenPSF` using Fourier methods, the entire power spectrum should
    generally be used.  On the other hand, when drawing using photon-shooting and the geometric
    approximation, it's better to truncate the high-k modes of the power spectrum here so
    that they can be handled instead by a SecondKick object (which also happens automatically; see
    the `PhaseScreenPSF` docstring).  (See Peterson et al. 2015 for more details about the second
    kick).  Querying the wavefront or wavefront gradient will instantiate the screen using the full
    power spectrum.

    This class will normally attempt to sanity check that the screen has been appropriately
    instantiated depending on the use case, i.e., depending on whether it's being used to draw with
    Fourier optics or geometric optics.  If you want to turn this warning off, however, you can
    use the ``suppress_warning`` keyword argument.

    If you wish to override the automatic truncation determination, then you can directly
    instantiate the phase screen array using the `AtmosphericScreen.instantiate` method.

    Note that once a screen has been instantiated with a particular set of truncation parameters, it
    cannot be re-instantiated with another set of parameters.

    **Shared memory**:

    Instantiated AtmosphericScreen objects can consume a significant amount of memory.  For example,
    an atmosphere with 6 screens, each extending 819.2 m and with resolution of 10 cm will consume
    3 GB of memory.  In contexts where both a realistic atmospheric PSF and high throughput via
    multiprocessing are required, allocating this 3 GB of memory once in a shared memory space
    accessible to each subprocess (as opposed to once per subprocess) is highly desireable.  We
    provide a few functions here to enable such usage:

        - The mp_context keyword argument to AtmosphericScreen.
          This is used to indicate which multiprocessing process launching context will be used.
          This is important for setting up the shared memory correctly.
        - The `initWorker` and `initWorkerArgs` functions.
          These should be used in a call to multiprocessing.Pool to correctly inform the worker
          process where to find AtmosphericScreen shared memory.

    A template example might look something like::

        import galsim
        import multiprocessing as mp

        def work(i, atm):
            args, moreArgs = fn(i)
            psf = atm.makePSF(*args)
            return psf.drawImage(*moreArgs)

        ctx = mp.get_context("spawn")  # "spawn" is generally the safest context available

        atm = galsim.Atmosphere(..., mp_context=ctx)  # internally calls AtmosphericScreen ctor
        nProc = 4  # Note, can set this to None to get a good default

        # Note: Especially if you are using "fork" context, then you want to make sure to run
        #       your Pool in a single_threaded context.  Even if not, it's probably a good idea
        #       so each process isn't spawning lots of OpenMP (or other) threads.
        with galsim.utilities.single_threaded():
            with ctx.Pool(
                nProc,
                initializer=galsim.phase_screens.initWorker,
                initargs=galsim.phase_screens.initWorkerArgs()
            ) as pool:
                results = []
                # First submit
                for i in range(10):
                    results.append(pool.apply_async(work, (i, atm)))
                # Then wait to finish
                for r in results:
                    r.wait()
        # Turn future objects into actual returned images.
        results = [r.get() for r in results]

    It is also possible to manually instantiate each of the AtmosphericScreen objects in a
    `PhaseScreenList` in parallel using a process pool.  This requires knowing what k-scale to
    truncate the screen at::

        atm = galsim.Atmosphere(..., mp_context=ctx)
        with galsim.utilities.single_threaded():
            with ctx.Pool(
                nProc,
                initializer=galsim.phase_screens.initWorker,
                initargs=galsim.phase_screens.initWorkerArgs()
            ) as pool:
                dummyPSF = atm.makePSF(...)
                kmax = dummyPSF.screen_kmax
                atm.instantiate(pool=pool, kmax=kmax)

    Finally, the above multiprocessing shared memory tricks are only currently supported for
    non-time-evolving screens (alpha=1).

    **Pickling**:

    The shared memory portion of an atmospheric screen is not included by default in the pickle of
    an `AtmosphericScreen` instance.  This means that while it is possible to pickle/unpickle an
    `AtmosphericScreen` as normal within a single launch of a potentially-multiprocess program, (as
    long as the shared memory is persistent), a different path is needed to say, create an
    `AtmosphericScreen` pickle, quit python, restart python, and unpickle the screen.  The same
    holds for any object that wraps an `AtmosphericScreen` as an attribute as well, which could
    include, e.g., `PhaseScreenList` or `PhaseScreenPSF`.

    To get around this limitation, the context manager `galsim.utilities.pickle_shared` can be
    used.  For example::

        screen = galsim.AtmosphericScreen(...)
        with galsim.utilities.pickle_shared():
            pickle.dump(screen, open('myScreen.pkl', 'wb'))

    will pickle both the screen object and any required shared memory used in its definition.
    Unpickling then proceeds exactly as normal::

        screen = pickle.load(open('myScreen.pkl', 'rb'))

    Parameters:
        screen_size:        Physical extent of square phase screen in meters.  This should be large
                            enough to accommodate the desired field-of-view of the telescope as
                            well as the meta-pupil defined by the wind speed and exposure time.
                            Note that the screen will have periodic boundary conditions, so while
                            the code will still run with a small screen, this may introduce
                            artifacts into PSFs or PSF correlation functions.  Also note that
                            screen_size may be tweaked by the initializer to ensure ``screen_size``
                            is a multiple of ``screen_scale``.
        screen_scale:       Physical pixel scale of phase screen in meters.  An order unity multiple
                            of the Fried parameter is usually sufficiently small, but users should
                            test the effects of varying this parameter to ensure robust results.
                            [default: r0_500]
        altitude:           Altitude of phase screen in km.  This is with respect to the telescope,
                            not sea-level.  [default: 0.0]
        r0_500:             Fried parameter setting the amplitude of turbulence; contributes to
                            "size" of the resulting atmospheric PSF.  Specified at wavelength 500
                            nm, in units of meters.  [default: 0.2]
        L0:                 Outer scale in meters.  The turbulence power spectrum will smoothly
                            approach a constant at scales larger than L0.  Set to ``None`` or
                            ``np.inf`` for a power spectrum without an outer scale.  [default: 25.0]
        vx:                 x-component wind velocity in meters/second.  [default: 0.]
        vy:                 y-component wind velocity in meters/second.  [default: 0.]
        alpha:              Square root of fraction of phase that is "remembered" between time_steps
                            (i.e., alpha**2 is the fraction remembered). The fraction
                            sqrt(1-alpha**2) is then the amount of turbulence freshly generated in
                            each step.  Setting alpha=1.0 results in a frozen-flow atmosphere.
                            Note that computing PSFs from frozen-flow atmospheres may be
                            significantly faster than computing PSFs with non-frozen-flow
                            atmospheres.  If ``alpha`` != 1.0, then it is required that a
                            ``time_step`` is also specified.  [default: 1.0]
        time_step:          Time interval between phase boiling updates.  Note that this is distinct
                            from the time interval used to integrate the PSF over time, which is set
                            by the ``time_step`` keyword argument to `PhaseScreenPSF` or
                            `PhaseScreenList.makePSF`.  If ``time_step`` is not None, then
                            it is required that ``alpha`` is set to something other than 1.0.
                            [default: None]
        rng:                Random number generator as a `BaseDeviate`.  If None, then use
                            the clock time or system entropy to seed a new generator.
                            [default: None]
        suppress_warning:   Turn off instantiation sanity checking.  (See above)  [default: False]
        mp_context          GalSim uses shared memory for phase screen allocation to better enable
                            multiprocessing.  Use this keyword to set the launch context for
                            multiprocessing.  Usually it will be sufficient to leave this at its
                            default.  [default: None]

def Atmosphere(screen_size, rng=None, _bar=None, **kwargs):
    r"""Create an atmosphere as a list of turbulent phase screens at different altitudes.  The
    atmosphere model can then be used to simulate atmospheric PSFs.

    Simulating an atmospheric PSF is typically accomplished by first representing the 3-dimensional
    turbulence in the atmosphere as a series of discrete 2-dimensional phase screens.  These screens
    may blow around in the wind, and may or may not also evolve in time.  This function allows one
    to quickly assemble a list of atmospheric phase screens into a `galsim.PhaseScreenList` object,
    which can then be used to evaluate PSFs through various columns of atmosphere at different field
    angles.

    The atmospheric screens currently available represent turbulence following a von Karman power
    spectrum.  Specifically, the phase power spectrum in each screen can be written

    .. math::
        \psi(\nu) = 0.023 r_0^{-5/3} \left(\nu^2 + \frac{1}{L_0^2}\right)^{11/6}

    where :math:`\psi(\nu)` is the power spectral density at spatial frequency :math:`\nu`,
    :math:`r_0` is the Fried parameter (which has dimensions of length) and sets the amplitude of
    the turbulence, and :math:`L_0` is the outer scale (also dimensions of length) beyond which the
    power asymptotically flattens.

    Typical values for :math:`r_0` are ~0.1 to 0.2 meters, which corresponds roughly to PSF FWHMs
    of ~0.5 to 1.0 arcsec for optical wavelengths.  Note that :math:`r_0` is a function of
    wavelength, scaling like :math:`r_0 \sim \lambda^{6/5}`.  To reduce confusion, the input
    parameter here is named ``r0_500`` and refers explicitly to the Fried parameter at a wavelength
    of 500 nm.  The outer scale is typically in the 10s of meters and does not vary with wavelength.

    To create multiple layers, simply specify keyword arguments as length-N lists instead of scalars
    (works for all arguments except ``rng``).  If, for any of these keyword arguments, you want to
    use the same value for each layer, then you can just specify the argument as a scalar and the
    function will automatically broadcast it into a list with length equal to the longest found
    keyword argument list.  Note that it is an error to specify keywords with lists of different
    lengths (unless only one of them has length > 1).

    The one exception to the above is the keyword ``r0_500``.  The effective Fried parameter for a
    set of atmospheric layers is::

        r0_500_effective = (sum(r**(-5./3) for r in r0_500s))**(-3./5)

    Providing ``r0_500`` as a scalar or single-element list will result in broadcasting such that
    the effective Fried parameter for the whole set of layers equals the input argument.  You can
    weight the contribution of each layer with the ``r0_weights`` keyword.

    As an example, the following code approximately creates the atmosphere used by Jee+Tyson(2011)
    for their study of atmospheric PSFs for LSST.  Note this code takes about ~2 minutes to run on
    a fast laptop, and will consume about (8192**2 pixels) * (8 bytes) * (6 screens) ~ 3 GB of
    RAM in its final state, and more at intermediate states.::

        >>> altitude = [0, 2.58, 5.16, 7.73, 12.89, 15.46]  # km
        >>> r0_500 = 0.16  # m
        >>> weights = [0.652, 0.172, 0.055, 0.025, 0.074, 0.022]
        >>> speed = np.random.uniform(0, 20, size=6)  # m/s
        >>> direction = [np.random.uniform(0, 360)*galsim.degrees for i in range(6)]
        >>> npix = 8192
        >>> screen_scale = r0_500
        >>> atm = galsim.Atmosphere(r0_500=r0_500, r0_weights=weights,
                                    screen_size=screen_scale*npix,
                                    altitude=altitude, L0=25.0, speed=speed,
                                    direction=direction, screen_scale=screen_scale)

    Once the atmosphere is constructed, a 15-sec exposure length, 5ms time step, monochromatic PSF
    at 700nm (using an 8.4 meter aperture, 0.6 fractional obscuration and otherwise default
    settings) takes about 7 minutes to draw on a fast laptop.::

        >>> psf = atm.makePSF(lam=700.0, exptime=15.0, time_step=0.005, diam=8.4, obscuration=0.6)
        >>> img1 = psf.drawImage()  # ~7 min

    The same psf, if drawn using photon-shooting on the same laptop, will generate photons at a rate
    of about 1 million per second.::

        >>> img2 = psf.drawImage(nx=32, ny=32, scale=0.2, method='phot', n_photons=1e6)  # ~1 sec.

    Note that the Fourier-based calculation compute time will scale linearly with exposure time,
    while the photon-shooting calculation compute time will scale linearly with the number of
    photons being shot.

    Many factors will affect the timing of results, of course, including aperture diameter, gsparams
    settings, pad_factor and oversampling options to makePSF, time_step and exposure time, frozen
    vs. non-frozen atmospheric layers, and so on.  We recommend that users try varying these
    settings to find a balance of speed and fidelity.

    Parameters:
        r0_500:         Fried parameter setting the amplitude of turbulence; contributes to "size"
                        of the resulting atmospheric PSF.  Specified at wavelength 500 nm, in units
                        of meters.  [default: 0.2]
        r0_weights:     Weights for splitting up the contribution of r0_500 between different
                        layers.  Note that this keyword is only allowed if r0_500 is either a
                        scalar or a single-element list.  [default: None]
        screen_size:    Physical extent of square phase screen in meters.  This should be large
                        enough to accommodate the desired field-of-view of the telescope as well as
                        the meta-pupil defined by the wind speed and exposure time.  Note that
                        the screen will have periodic boundary conditions, so the code will run
                        with a smaller sized screen, though this may introduce artifacts into PSFs
                        or PSF correlation functions. Note that screen_size may be tweaked by the
                        initializer to ensure screen_size is a multiple of screen_scale.
        screen_scale:   Physical pixel scale of phase screen in meters.  A fraction of the Fried
                        parameter is usually sufficiently small, but users should test the effects
                        of this parameter to ensure robust results.
                        [default: same as each screen's r0_500]
        altitude:       Altitude of phase screen in km.  This is with respect to the telescope, not
                        sea-level.  [default: 0.0]
        L0:             Outer scale in meters.  The turbulence power spectrum will smoothly
                        approach a constant at scales larger than L0.  Set to ``None`` or ``np.inf``
                        for a power spectrum without an outer scale.  [default: 25.0]
        speed:          Wind speed in meters/second.  [default: 0.0]
        direction:      Wind direction as `galsim.Angle` [default: 0.0 * galsim.degrees]
        alpha:          Square root of fraction of phase that is "remembered" between time_steps
                        (i.e., alpha**2 is the fraction remembered). The fraction sqrt(1-alpha**2)
                        is then the amount of turbulence freshly generated in each step.  Setting
                        alpha=1.0 results in a frozen-flow atmosphere.  Note that computing PSFs
                        from frozen-flow atmospheres may be significantly faster than computing
                        PSFs with non-frozen-flow atmospheres.  [default: 1.0]
        time_step:      Time interval between phase boiling updates.  Note that this is distinct
                        from the time interval used when integrating the PSF over time, which is
                        set by the ``time_step`` keyword argument to `PhaseScreenPSF` or
                        `PhaseScreenList.makePSF`.  If ``time_step`` is not None, then it is
                        required that ``alpha`` is set to something other than 1.0.  [default: None]
        rng:            Random number generator as a `BaseDeviate`.  If None, then use the
                        clock time or system entropy to seed a new generator.  [default: None]
