Module containing code for estimating shear power spectra from shears at gridded positions.

The code below was developed largely by Joe Zuntz and tweaked by assorted GalSim
developers.  This development and testing took place in a separate (private) repository before the
code was moved into the GalSim repository, but there are some demonstrations of the performance of
this code in devel/modules/lensing_engine.pdf

class PowerSpectrumEstimator(object):
    """
    Class for estimating the shear power spectrum from gridded shears.

    The PowerSpectrumEstimator class can be used even on systems where GalSim is not installed.
    It just requires NumPy.

    This class stores all the data used in power spectrum estimation that is fixed with the geometry
    of the problem - the binning and spin weighting factors.

    The only public method is estimate(), which is called with 2D `g1` and `g2` arrays on a square
    grid.  It assumes the flat sky approximation (where `ell` and `k` are interchangeable), and
    rebins the observed ell modes into a user-defined number of logarithimic bins in ell.  Given
    that the grid parameters are precomputed and stored when the PowerSpectrumEstimator is
    initialized, computation of the PS for multiple sets of shears corresponding to the same grid
    setup can proceed more rapidly than if everything had to be recomputed each time.

    Below is an example of how to use this code (relying on GalSim to provide the arrays of g1 and
    g2, though that is by no means required, and assuming that the user is sitting in the examples/
    directory):

        >>> grid_size = 10.  # Define the total grid extent, in degrees
        >>> ngrid = 100      # Define the number of grid points in each dimension: (ngrid x ngrid)
        >>> n_ell = 15       # Choose the number of logarithmic bins in ell or k for outputs
        >>>
        >>> # Define a lookup-table for the power spectrum as a function of k based on the outputs
        >>> # of iCosmo (see demo11.py for more description of how this was generated).
        >>> my_tab = galsim.LookupTable(file='data/cosmo-fid.zmed1.00.out')
        >>>
        >>> # Generate a galsim.PowerSpectrum with this P(k), noting the units.
        >>> my_ps = galsim.PowerSpectrum(my_tab, units=galsim.radians)
        >>>
        >>> # Build a grid of shear values with the desired parameters.
        >>> g1, g2 = my_ps.buildGrid(grid_spacing=grid_size/ngrid, ngrid=ngrid,
        ...                          units=galsim.degrees)
        >>>
        >>> # Initialize a PowerSpectrumEstimator with the chosen grid geometry and number of ell
        >>> # bins. Note that these values are actually the default, so we didn't technically have
        >>> # to specifythem.
        >>> my_pse = galsim.pse.PowerSpectrumEstimator(ngrid, grid_size, n_ell)
        >>>
        >>> # Estimate the power based on this set of g1, g2.  If we get another set of shears for
        >>> # the same grid geometry, we can reuse the same PowerSpectrumEstimator object.
        >>> ell, P_e, P_b, P_eb = my_pse.estimate(g1, g2)

    The output NumPy arrays `ell`, `P_e`, `P_b`, and `P_eb` contain the effective ell value, the
    E-mode auto-power spectrum, the B-mode auto-power spectrum, and the EB cross-power spectrum.
    The units are inverse radians for ell, and radians^2 for the output power spectra.

    Some important notes:

    1) Power spectrum estimation requires a weight function which decides how the averaging is done
    across ell within each bin.  By default that weighting is flat in ell using an analytic
    calculation of the area in ell space, but this is easy to change with the `_bin_power` function.
    (Note this area averaged bin weighting is only approximate for the higher frequency bins in
    which the lower `ell` edge is greater than `pi * ngrid / grid_size`, due to the annular `ell`
    region being cut off by the square grid edges beyond this value.)  A keyword allows for
    weighting by the power itself, but use of this functionality requires the GalSim software
    package.

    2) This is the power spectrum of the gridded *data*, not the underlying field - we do not
    account for the effects of the finite grid (basically, ignoring all the reasons why power
    spectrum estimation is hard - see devel/modules/lensing_engine.pdf in the GalSim repository).
    Users must account for the contribution of noise in `g1`, `g2` and any masking.

    3) The binning is currently fixed as uniform in log(ell).

    4) The code for this class uses the notation of the GREAT10 handbook (Kitching et al. 2011,
    http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/11-AOAS484), equations 17-21.
