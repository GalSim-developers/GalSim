"""@file chromatic.py
Define wavelength-dependent surface brightness profiles.

Implementation is done by constructing GSObjects as functions of wavelength. The drawImage()
method then integrates over wavelength while also multiplying by a throughput function.

Possible uses include galaxies with color gradients, automatically drawing a given galaxy through
different filters, or implementing wavelength-dependent point spread functions.

class ChromaticObject(object):
    """Base class for defining wavelength-dependent objects.

    This class primarily serves as the base class for chromatic subclasses, including Chromatic,
    ChromaticSum, and ChromaticConvolution.  See the docstrings for these classes for more details.

    Initialization
    --------------

    A ChromaticObject can also be instantiated directly from an existing GSObject.
    In this case, the newly created ChromaticObject will act nearly the same way the original
    GSObject works, except that it has access to the ChromaticObject methods described below;
    especially expand(), dilate() and shift().

    @param gsobj  The GSObject to be chromaticized.

    Methods
    -------

    gsobj = chrom_obj.evaluateAtWavelength(lambda) returns the monochromatic surface brightness
    profile (as a GSObject) at a given wavelength (in nanometers).

    The interpolate() method can be used for non-separable ChromaticObjects to expedite the
    image rendering process.  See the docstring of that method for more details and discussion of
    when this is a useful tool (and the interplay between interpolation, object
    transformations, and convolutions).

    Also, ChromaticObject has most of the same methods as GSObjects with the following exceptions:

    The GSObject access methods (e.g. xValue(), maxK(), etc.) are not available.  Instead,
    you would need to evaluate the profile at a particular wavelength and access what you want
    from that.

    There is no withFlux() method, since this is in general undefined for a chromatic object.
    See the SED class for how to set a chromatic flux density function.

    The transformation methods: transform(), expand(), dilate(), magnify(), shear(), rotate(),
    lens(), and shift() can now accept functions of wavelength as arguments, as opposed to the
    constants that GSObjects are limited to.  These methods can be used to effect a variety of
    physical chromatic effects, such as differential chromatic refraction, chromatic seeing, and
    diffraction-limited wavelength-dependence.

    The drawImage() method draws the object as observed through a particular bandpass, so the
    function parameters are somewhat different.  See the docstring for ChromaticObject.drawImage()
    for more details.

    The drawKImage() method is not yet implemented.
    """

    # In general, `ChromaticObject` and subclasses should provide the following interface:
    # 1) Define an `evaluateAtWavelength` method, which returns a GSObject representing the
    #    profile at a particular wavelength.
    # 2) Define a `withScaledFlux` method, which scales the flux at all wavelengths by a fixed
    #    multiplier.
    # 3) Potentially define their own `__repr__` and `__str__` methods.  Note that the default
    #    assumes that `.obj` is the only attribute of significance, but this isn't always
    #    appropriate, (e.g. ChromaticSum, ChromaticConvolution).
    # 4) Initialize a `separable` attribute.  This marks whether (`separable = True`) or not
    #    (`separable = False`) the given chromatic profile can be factored into a spatial profile
    #    and a spectral profile.  Separable profiles can be drawn quickly by evaluating at a single
    #    wavelength and adjusting the flux via a (fast) 1D integral over the spectral component.
    #    Inseparable profiles, on the other hand, need to be evaluated at multiple wavelengths
    #    in order to draw (slow).
    # 5) Separable objects must initialize an `SED` attribute, which is a callable object (often a
    #    `galsim.SED` instance) that returns the _relative_ flux of the profile at a given
    #    wavelength. (The _absolute_ flux is controlled by both the `SED` and the `.flux` attribute
    #    of the underlying chromaticized GSObject(s).  See `galsim.Chromatic` docstring for details
    #    concerning normalization.)
    # 6) Initialize a `wave_list` attribute, which specifies wavelengths at which the profile (or
    #    the SED in the case of separable profiles) will be evaluated when drawing a
    #    ChromaticObject.  The type of `wave_list` should be a numpy array, and may be empty, in
    #    which case either the Bandpass object being drawn against, or the integrator being used
    #    will determine at which wavelengths to evaluate.

    # Additionally, instances of `ChromaticObject` and subclasses will usually have either an `obj`
    # attribute representing a manipulated `GSObject` or `ChromaticObject`, or an `objlist`
    # attribute in the case of compound classes like `ChromaticSum` and `ChromaticConvolution`.

        This method is used as a pre-processing step that can expedite image rendering using objects
        that have to be built up as sums of GSObjects with different parameters at each wavelength,
        by interpolating between Images at each wavelength instead of making a more costly
        instantiation of the relevant GSObject at each value of wavelength at which the bandpass is
        defined.  This routine does a costly initialization process to build up a grid of images to
        be used for the interpolation later on.  However, the object can get reused with different
        bandpasses, so there should not be any need to make many versions of this object, and there
        is a significant savings each time it is drawn into an image.  As a general rule of thumb,
        chromatic objects that are separable do not benefit from this particular optimization,
        whereas those that involve making GSObjects with wavelength-dependent keywords or
        transformations do benefit from it.  Note that the interpolation scheme is simple linear
        interpolation in wavelength, and no extrapolation beyond the originally-provided range of
        wavelengths is permitted.

        The speedup involved in using interpolation depends in part on the bandpass used for
        rendering (since that determines how many full profile evaluations are involved in rendering
        the image).  However, for ChromaticAtmosphere with simple profiles like Kolmogorov, the
        speedup in some simple example cases is roughly a factor of three, whereas for more
        expensive to render profiles like the ChromaticOpticalPSF, the speedup is more typically a
        factor of 10-50.

        Achromatic transformations can be applied either before or after setting up interpolation,
        with the best option depending on the application.  For example, when rendering many times
        with the same achromatic transformation applied, it is typically advantageous to apply the
        transformation before setting up the interpolation.  But there is no value in this when
        applying different achromatic transformation to each object.  Chromatic transformations
        should be applied before setting up interpolation; attempts to render images of
        ChromaticObjects with interpolation followed by a chromatic transformation will result in
        the interpolation being unset and the full calculation being done.

        Because of the clever way that the ChromaticConvolution routine works, convolutions of
        separable chromatic objects with non-separable ones that use interpolation will still
        benefit from these optimizations.  For example, a non-separable chromatic PSF that uses
        interpolation, when convolved with a sum of two separable galaxy components each with their
        own SED, will be able to take advantage of this optimization.  In contrast, when convolving
        two non-separable profiles that already have interpolation set up, there is no way to take
        advantage of that interpolation optimization, so it will be ignored and the full calculation
        will be done.  However, interpolation can be set up for the convolution of two non-separable
        profiles, after the convolution step.  This could be beneficial for example when convolving
        a chromatic optical PSF and chromatic atmosphere, before convolving with multiple galaxy
        profiles.

        For use cases requiring a high level of precision, we recommend a comparison between the
        interpolated and the more accurate calculation for at least one case, to ensure that the
        required precision has been reached.

        The input parameter `waves` determines the input grid on which images are precomputed.  It
        is difficult to give completely general guidance as to how many wavelengths to choose or how
        they should be spaced; some experimentation compared with the exact calculation is warranted
        for each particular application.  The best choice of settings might depend on how strongly
        the parameters of the object depend on wavelength.

        @param waves            The list, tuple, or NumPy array of wavelengths to be used when
                                building up the grid of images for interpolation.  The wavelengths
                                should be given in nanometers, and they should span the full range
                                of wavelengths covered by any bandpass to be used for drawing Images
                                (i.e., this class will not extrapolate beyond the given range of
                                wavelengths).  They can be spaced any way the user likes, not
                                necessarily linearly, though interpolation will be linear in
                                wavelength between the specified wavelengths.
        @param oversample_fac   Factor by which to oversample the stored profiles compared to the

                                whichever wavelength has the highest Nyquist frequency.
                                `oversample_fac`>1 results in higher accuracy but costlier

    def drawImage(self, bandpass, image=None, integrator='trapezoidal', **kwargs):
        """Base implementation for drawing an image of a ChromaticObject.

        Some subclasses may choose to override this for specific efficiency gains.  For instance,
        most GalSim use cases will probably finish with a convolution, in which case
        ChromaticConvolution.drawImage() will be used.

        The task of drawImage() in a chromatic context is to integrate a chromatic surface
        brightness profile multiplied by the throughput of `bandpass`, over the wavelength interval
        indicated by `bandpass`.

        Several integrators are available in galsim.integ to do this integration when using the
        first method (non-interpolated integration).  By default,
        `galsim.integ.SampleIntegrator(rule=np.trapz)` will be used if either
        `bandpass.wave_list` or `self.wave_list` have len() > 0.  If lengths of both are zero, which
        may happen if both the bandpass throughput and the SED associated with `self` are analytic
        python functions, for example, then `galsim.integ.ContinuousIntegrator(rule=np.trapz)`
        will be used instead.  This latter case by default will evaluate the integrand at 250
        equally-spaced wavelengths between `bandpass.blue_limit` and `bandpass.red_limit`.

        By default, the above two integrators will use the trapezoidal rule for integration.  The
        midpoint rule for integration can be specified instead by passing an integrator that has
        been initialized with the `rule=galsim.integ.midpt` argument.  When creating a
        ContinuousIntegrator, the number of samples `N` is also an argument.  For example:

            >>> integrator = galsim.ContinuousIntegrator(rule=galsim.integ.midpt, N=100)
            >>> image = chromatic_obj.drawImage(bandpass, integrator=integrator)

        Finally, this method uses a cache to avoid recomputing the integral over the product of
        the bandpass and object SED when possible (i.e., for separable profiles).  Because the
        cache size is finite, users may find that it is more efficient when drawing many images
        to group images using the same SEDs and bandpasses together in order to hit the cache more
        often.  The default cache size is 10, but may be resized using the
        `ChromaticObject.resize_multiplier_cache()` method.

                                integrate.
        @param image            Optionally, the Image to draw onto.  (See GSObject.drawImage()

                                'trapezoidal' or 'midpoint', in which case the routine will use a
                                SampleIntegrator or ContinuousIntegrator depending on whether or not
                                the object has a `wave_list`.  [default: 'trapezoidal',

class ChromaticAtmosphere(ChromaticObject):
    """A ChromaticObject implementing two atmospheric chromatic effects: differential
    chromatic refraction (DCR) and wavelength-dependent seeing.

    Due to DCR, blue photons land closer to the zenith than red photons.  Kolmogorov turbulence
    also predicts that blue photons get spread out more by the atmosphere than red photons,
    specifically FWHM is proportional to wavelength^(-0.2).  Both of these effects can be
    implemented by wavelength-dependent shifts and dilations.

    Since DCR depends on the zenith angle and the parallactic angle (which is the position angle of
    the zenith measured from North through East) of the object being drawn, these must be specified
    via keywords.  There are four ways to specify these values:
      1) explicitly provide `zenith_angle = ...` as a keyword of type Angle, and
         `parallactic_angle` will be assumed to be 0 by default.
      2) explicitly provide both `zenith_angle = ...` and `parallactic_angle = ...` as
         keywords of type Angle.
      3) provide the coordinates of the object `obj_coord = ...` and the coordinates of the zenith
         `zenith_coord = ...` as keywords of type CelestialCoord.
      4) provide the coordinates of the object `obj_coord = ...` as a CelestialCoord, the
         hour angle of the object `HA = ...` as an Angle, and the latitude of the observer
         `latitude = ...` as an Angle.

    DCR also depends on temperature, pressure and water vapor pressure of the atmosphere.  The
    default values for these are expected to be appropriate for LSST at Cerro Pachon, Chile, but
    they are broadly reasonable for most observatories.

    Note that this function implicitly assumes that lengths are in arcseconds.  Thus, to use this
    function, you should specify properties like FWHM, half_light_radius, and pixel scales in
    arcsec.  This is unlike the rest of GalSim, in which Position units only need to be internally
    consistent.

    Note that a ChromaticAtmosphere by itself is NOT the correct thing to use to draw an image of a
    star. Stars (and galaxies too, of course) have an SED that is not flat. To draw a real star, you
    should either multiply the ChromaticAtmosphere object by an SED, or convolve it with a point
    source (typically approximated by a very tiny Gaussian) multiplied by an SED:

        >>> psf = galsim.ChromaticAtmosphere(...)
        >>> star = galsim.Gaussian(sigma = 1.e-6) * psf_sed
        >>> final_star = galsim.Convolve( [psf, star] )
        >>> final_star.drawImage(bandpass = bp, ...)

        >>> disk = galsim.Chromatic(disk_mono, disk_SED)
        >>> gal = bulge + disk

    Some syntactic sugar available for creating Chromatic instances is simply to multiply
    a GSObject instance by an SED instance.  Thus the last three lines above are equivalent to:

        >>> gal = bulge_mono * bulge_SED + disk_mono * disk_SED

    The SED is usually specified as a galsim.SED object, though any callable that returns
    spectral density in photons/nanometer as a function of wavelength in nanometers should work.

    Typically, the SED describes the flux in photons per nanometer of an object with a particular
    magnitude, possibly normalized with either the method sed.withFlux() or sed.withMagnitude()
    (see the docstrings in the SED class for details about these and other normalization options).
    Then the `flux` attribute of the GSObject should just be the _relative_ flux scaling of the
    current object compared to that normalization.  This implies (at least) two possible
    conventions.
    1. You can normalize the SED to have unit flux with `sed = sed.withFlux(1.0, bandpass)`. Then
    the `flux` of each GSObject would be the actual flux in photons when observed in the given
    bandpass.
    2. You can leave the object flux as 1 (the default for most types when you construct them) and
    set the flux in the SED with `sed = sed.withFlux(flux, bandpass)`.  Then if the object had
    `flux` attribute different from 1, it would just refer to the factor by which that particular
    object is brighter than the value given in the normalization command.

class ChromaticOpticalPSF(ChromaticObject):
    """A subclass of ChromaticObject meant to represent chromatic optical PSFs.

    Chromaticity plays two roles in optical PSFs. First, it determines the diffraction limit, via
    the wavelength/diameter factor.  Second, aberrations such as defocus, coma, etc. are typically
    defined in physical distances, but their impact on the PSF depends on their size in units of
    wavelength.  Other aspects of the optical PSF do not require explicit specification of their
    chromaticity, e.g., once the obscuration and struts are specified in units of the aperture
    diameter, their chromatic dependence gets taken care of automatically.  Note that the
    ChromaticOpticalPSF implicitly defines diffraction limits in units of `scale_units`, which by
    default are arcsec, but can in principle be set to any of our GalSim angle units.

    When using interpolation to speed up image rendering (see ChromaticObject.interpolate()
    method for details), the ideal number of wavelengths to use across a given bandpass depends on
    the application and accuracy requirements.  In general it will be necessary to do a test in
    comparison with a more exact calculation to ensure convergence.  However, a typical calculation
    might use ~10-15 samples across a typical optical bandpass, with `oversample_fac` in the range
    1.5-2; for moderate accuracy, ~5 samples across the bandpass and `oversample_fac=1` may
    suffice. All of these statements assume that aberrations are not very large (typically <~0.25
    waves, which is commonly satisfied by space telescopes); if they are larger than that, then more
    stringent settings are required.

    Note that a ChromaticOpticalPSF by itself is NOT the correct thing to use to draw an image of a
    star. Stars (and galaxies too, of course) have an SED that is not flat. To draw a real star, you
    should either multiply the ChromaticOpticalPSF object by an SED, or convolve it with a point
    source (typically approximated by a very tiny Gaussian) multiplied by an SED:

        >>> psf = galsim.ChromaticOpticalPSF(...)
        >>> star = galsim.Gaussian(sigma = 1.e-6) * psf_sed
        >>> final_star = galsim.Convolve( [psf, star] )
        >>> final_star.drawImage(bandpass = bp, ...)
