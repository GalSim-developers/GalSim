"""@file chromatic.py
Define wavelength-dependent surface brightness profiles.

Implementation is done by constructing GSObjects as functions of wavelength. The drawImage()
method then integrates over wavelength while also multiplying by a throughput function.

Possible uses include galaxies with color gradients, automatically drawing a given galaxy through
different filters, or implementing wavelength-dependent point spread functions.

class ChromaticObject(object):
    """Base class for defining wavelength-dependent objects.

    This class primarily serves as the base class for chromatic subclasses, including Chromatic,
    ChromaticSum, and ChromaticConvolution.  See the docstrings for these classes for more details.
    The ChromaticAtmosphere() function also creates a ChromaticObject.

    Initialization
    --------------

    A ChromaticObject can also be instantiated directly from an existing GSObject.
    In this case, the newly created ChromaticObject will act nearly the same way the original
    GSObject works, except that it has access to the ChromaticObject methods described below;
    especially expand(), dilate() and shift().

    @param gsobj  The GSObject to be chromaticized.

    Methods
    -------

    gsobj = chrom_obj.evaluateAtWavelength(lambda) returns the monochromatic surface brightness
    profile (as a GSObject) at a given wavelength (in nanometers).

    Also, ChromaticObject has most of the same methods as GSObjects with the following exceptions:

    The GSObject access methods (e.g. xValue(), maxK(), etc.) are not available.  Instead,
    you would need to evaluate the profile at a particular wavelength and access what you want
    from that.

    There is no withFlux() method, since this is in general undefined for a chromatic object.
    See the SED class for how to set a chromatic flux density function.

    The transformation methods: transform(), expand(), dilate(), magnify(), shear(), rotate(),
    lens(), and shift() can now accept functions of wavelength as arguments, as opposed to the
    constants that GSObjects are limited to.  These methods can be used to effect a variety of
    physical chromatic effects, such as differential chromatic refraction, chromatic seeing, and
    diffraction-limited wavelength-dependence.

    The drawImage() method draws the object as observed through a particular bandpass, so the
    function parameters are somewhat different.  See the docstring for ChromaticObject.drawImage()
    for more details.

    The drawKImage() method is not yet implemented.
    """

    # In general, `ChromaticObject` and subclasses should provide the following interface:
    # 1) Define an `evaluateAtWavelength` method, which returns a GSObject representing the
    #    profile at a particular wavelength.
    # 2) Define a `withScaledFlux` method, which scales the flux at all wavelengths by a fixed
    #    multiplier.
    # 3) Initialize a `separable` attribute.  This marks whether (`separable = True`) or not
    #    (`separable = False`) the given chromatic profile can be factored into a spatial profile
    #    and a spectral profile.  Separable profiles can be drawn quickly by evaluating at a single
    #    wavelength and adjusting the flux via a (fast) 1D integral over the spectral component.
    #    Inseparable profiles, on the other hand, need to be evaluated at multiple wavelengths
    #    in order to draw (slow).
    # 4) Separable objects must initialize an `SED` attribute, which is a callable object (often a
    #    `galsim.SED` instance) that returns the _relative_ flux of the profile at a given
    #    wavelength. (The _absolute_ flux is controlled by both the `SED` and the `.flux` attribute
    #    of the underlying chromaticized GSObject(s).  See `galsim.Chromatic` docstring for details
    #    concerning normalization.)
    # 5) Initialize a `wave_list` attribute, which specifies wavelengths at which the profile (or
    #    the SED in the case of separable profiles) will be evaluated when drawing a
    #    ChromaticObject.  The type of `wave_list` should be a numpy array, and may be empty, in
    #    which case either the Bandpass object being drawn against, or the integrator being used
    #    will determine at which wavelengths to evaluate.

    # Additionally, instances of `ChromaticObject` and subclasses will usually have either an `obj`
    # attribute representing a manipulated `GSObject` or `ChromaticObject`, or an `objlist`
    # attribute in the case of compound classes like `ChromaticSum` and `ChromaticConvolution`.

        """Base implementation for drawing an image of a ChromaticObject.

        Some subclasses may choose to override this for specific efficiency gains.  For instance,
        most GalSim use cases will probably finish with a convolution, in which case
        ChromaticConvolution.drawImage() will be used.

        The task of drawImage() in a chromatic context is to integrate a chromatic surface
        brightness profile multiplied by the throughput of `bandpass`, over the wavelength interval
        indicated by `bandpass`.

        Several integrators are available in galsim.integ to do this integration.  By default,
        `galsim.integ.SampleIntegrator(rule=np.trapz)` will be used if either
        `bandpass.wave_list` or `self.wave_list` have len() > 0.  If lengths of both are zero, which
        may happen if both the bandpass throughput and the SED associated with `self` are analytic
        python functions, for example, then `galsim.integ.ContinuousIntegrator(rule=np.trapz)`
        will be used instead.  This latter case by default will evaluate the integrand at 250
        equally-spaced wavelengths between `bandpass.blue_limit` and `bandpass.red_limit`.

        By default, the above two integrators will use the trapezoidal rule for integration.  The
        midpoint rule for integration can be specified instead by passing an integrator that has
        been initialized with the `rule=galsim.integ.midpt` argument.  Finally, when creating a
        ContinuousIntegrator, the number of samples `N` is also an argument.  For example:

            >>> integrator = galsim.ContinuousIntegrator(rule=galsim.integ.midpt, N=100)
            >>> image = chromatic_obj.drawImage(bandpass, integrator=integrator)

def ChromaticAtmosphere(base_obj, base_wavelength, **kwargs):
    """Return a ChromaticObject implementing two atmospheric chromatic effects: differential
    chromatic refraction (DCR) and wavelength-dependent seeing.

    Due to DCR, blue photons land closer to the zenith than red photons.  Kolmogorov turbulence
    also predicts that blue photons get spread out more by the atmosphere than red photons,
    specifically FWHM is proportional to wavelength^(-0.2).  Both of these effects can be
    implemented by wavelength-dependent shifts and dilations.

    Since DCR depends on the zenith angle and the parallactic angle (which is the position angle of
    the zenith measured from North through East) of the object being drawn, these must be specified
    via keywords.  There are four ways to specify these values:
      1) explicitly provide `zenith_angle = ...` as a keyword of type Angle, and
         `parallactic_angle` will be assumed to be 0 by default.
      2) explicitly provide both `zenith_angle = ...` and `parallactic_angle = ...` as
         keywords of type Angle.
      3) provide the coordinates of the object `obj_coord = ...` and the coordinates of the zenith
         `zenith_coord = ...` as keywords of type CelestialCoord.
      4) provide the coordinates of the object `obj_coord = ...` as a CelestialCoord, the
         hour angle of the object `HA = ...` as an Angle, and the latitude of the observer
         `latitude = ...` as an Angle.

    DCR also depends on temperature, pressure and water vapor pressure of the atmosphere.  The
    default values for these are expected to be appropriate for LSST at Cerro Pachon, Chile, but
    they are broadly reasonable for most observatories.

    Note that this function implicitly assumes that lengths are in arcseconds.  Thus, to use this
    function, you should specify properties like FWHM, half_light_radius, and pixel scales in
    arcsec.  This is unlike the rest of GalSim, in which Position units only need to be internally
    consistent.

        >>> disk_mono = galsim.Exponential(half_light_radius=2.0)

        >>> disk = galsim.Chromatic(disk_mono, disk_SED)
        >>> gal = bulge + disk

    Some syntactic sugar available for creating Chromatic instances is simply to multiply
    a GSObject instance by an SED instance.  Thus the last three lines above are equivalent to:

        >>> gal = bulge_mono * bulge_SED + disk_mono * disk_SED

    The SED is usually specified as a galsim.SED object, though any callable that returns
    spectral density in photons/nanometer as a function of wavelength in nanometers should work.

    Typically, the SED describes the flux in photons per nanometer of an object with a particular
    magnitude, possibly normalized with either the method sed.withFlux() or sed.withMagnitude()
    (see the docstrings in the SED class for details about these and other normalization options).
    Then the `flux` attribute of the GSObject should just be the _relative_ flux scaling of the
    current object compared to that normalization.  This implies (at least) two possible
    conventions.
    1. You can normalize the SED to have unit flux with `sed = sed.withFlux(1.0, bandpass)`. Then
    the `flux` of each GSObject would be the actual flux in photons when observed in the given
    bandpass.
    2. You can leave the object flux as 1 (the default for most types when you construct them) and
    set the flux in the SED with `sed = sed.withFlux(flux, bandpass)`.  Then if the object had
    `flux` attribute different from 1, it would just refer to the factor by which that particular
    object is brighter than the value given in the normalization command.

class InterpolatedChromaticObject(ChromaticObject):
    """Class for defining wavelength-dependent objects that can be described in terms of
    combinations of GSObjects with wavelength-dependent keywords or transformations (shifts, shears,
    etc.).

    This class is intended to expedite calculations using objects that have to be built up as sums
    of GSObjects with different parameters at each wavelength, by interpolating between Images at
    each wavelength instead of making a more costly instantiation of the relevant GSObject at each
    value of wavelength at which the bandpass is defined.  In order to carry out this interpolation,
    there is a costly initialization process to build up a grid of images to be used for the
    interpolation later on.  However, the object can get reused with different SEDs and bandpasses,
    so there should not be any need to make many versions of any particular type of
    InterpolatedChromaticObject, and there is a significant savings each time it is called.  Note
    that the interpolation scheme is simple linear interpolation in wavelength, and no extrapolation
    beyond the original range of wavelengths is permitted.

    It is possible to override the interpolation and instantiate a new GSObject at each value of
    wavelength.  This is slower, but should be more accurate.  The calling sequence for this mode is
    nearly identical to the first mode, except for one keyword argument (`waves`, see below).  For
    use cases requiring a high level of precision, we recommend a comparison between the
    interpolated and the more accurate calculation for at least one case, to ensure that the
    required precision has been reached.

    This class inherits from ChromaticObject, and subclasses of it could be defined to describe
    objects like chromatic PSFs.  See, for example, the subclass ChromaticOpticalPSF.  Subclasses of
    InterpolatedChromaticObject must have a method called `simpleEvaluateAtWavelength`, which is
    functionally the equivalent of `evaluateAtWavelength` for ChromaticObjects (i.e., it's a way to
    directly instantiate a GSObject at a single wavelength, without doing any interpolation).  Note
    that since InterpolatedChromaticObjects can include an SED, the `simpleEvaluateAtWavelength`
    method must include proper flux normalization for that wavelength.  However, if the
    InterpolatedChromaticObject is only going to be drawn when convolved by another object with an
    SED, then this is unnecessary.

    The input parameter `waves` determines the input grid on which images are precomputed.  It is
    difficult to give completely general guidance as to how many wavelengths to choose or how they
    should be spaced; some experimentation compared with the exact calculation (`waves`=None) is
    warranted for each particular application.  The best choice of settings might depend on how
    strongly the parameters of the object depend on wavelength.

    @param waves            The list, tuple, or NumPy array of wavelengths to be used when building
                            up the grid of images for interpolation.  The wavelengths should be
                            given in nanometers, and they should span the full range of wavelengths
                            covered by any bandpass to be used for drawing Images (i.e., this class
                            will not extrapolate beyond the given range of wavelengths).  If None,
                            then the InterpolatedChromaticObject will do the costlier, more exact
                            calculation instead of interpolating between Images defined at specific
                            wavelengths.
    @param SED              A galsim.SED for the object.  If None, a flat SED is used.  When using
                            the object as a PSF to be convolved by a chromatic object, a flat SED

class ChromaticOpticalPSF(InterpolatedChromaticObject):
    """A subclass of InterpolatedChromaticObject meant to represent chromatic optical PSFs.

    This class is a way of including chromatic effects on optical PSFs.  Chromaticity plays two
    roles: First, it determines the diffraction limit, via the wavelength/diameter factor.  Second,
    aberrations such as defocus, coma, etc. are typically defined in physical distances, but their
    impact on the PSF depends on their size in units of wavelength.  Other aspects of the optical
    PSF are achromatic, e.g., the obscuration and struts.

    For high accuracy calculations, setting `waves` to include ~10-15 samples across any given
    bandpass should be sufficient.  For moderate accuracy, 5 is often sufficient.  Likewise, for
    high accuracy, `oversample_fac` should be in the range 1.5-2, whereas for moderate accuracy, 1
    is often sufficient.  All of these statements assume that aberrations are not very large
    (typically <~0.25 waves, which is commonly satisfied by space telescopes); if they are larger
    than that, then more stringent settings are required.

    @param   diam          Telescope diameter in meters.
    @param   aberrations   An array of aberrations, in nanometers.  The size and format of this
                           array is described in the OpticalPSF docstring.
    @param   waves         Set of wavelengths defining the grid for interpolation, in nanometers. If
                           None, then no interpolation will be done and the more costly exact
                           calculation will be done.  Note that `waves` can be spaced in any way
                           (i.e. it does not have to be linearly, logarithmic, or regular according
                           to any scheme), but the interpolation between wavelengths is strictly
                           linear.
    @param oversample_fac  Factor by which to oversample the stored profiles compared to the
                           default, which is to sample them at the Nyquist frequency for whichever
                           wavelength has the highest Nyquist frequency.  `oversample_fac`>1
                           results in higher accuracy, but slower calculations. [default: 1]
    @param   **kwargs      Any other keyword arguments to be passed to OpticalPSF, for example,
                           related to struts, obscuration, oversampling, etc.  See OpticalPSF
                           docstring for a complete list of options.
