GalSim: The modular galaxy image simulation toolkit

GalSim is open-source software for simulating images of astronomical objects
(stars, galaxies) in a variety of ways.  The bulk of the calculations are
carried out in C++, and the user interface is in python.  In addition, the code
can operate directly on "config" files, for those users who prefer not to work
in python.  The impetus for the software package was a weak lensing community
data challenge, called GREAT3:

https://github.com/barnabytprowe/great3-public

However, the code has numerous additional capabilities beyond those needed for
the challenge, and has been useful for a number of projects that needed to
simulate high-fidelity galaxy images with accurate sizes and shears.

For an overview of GalSim workflow and python tools, please see the file
`doc/GalSim_Quick_Reference.pdf` in the GalSim repository.  A guide to using
the configuration files to generate simulations, a FAQ for installation issues,
a link to Doxygen-generated documentation, and other useful references can be
found on the GalSim wiki,

If you experience any issues with the software, or if you would like to file
a feature request, please do so on the main github site for GalSim,
