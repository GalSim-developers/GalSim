    A _CorrFunc will not generally be instantiated directly.  This is recommended as the current
    `_CorrFunc.__init__` interface does not provide any guarantee that the input `GSObject`
    represents a physical correlation function, e.g. a profile that is an even function (two-fold
    rotationally symmetric in the plane) and peaked at the origin.  The proposed pattern is that
    users instead instantiate derived classes, such as the `ImageCorrFunc`, which are able to
    guarantee the above. 

    The _CorrFunc is therefore here primarily to define the way in which derived classes (currently
    only the  `ImageCorrFunc`) store the correlation function profile, allow operations with it,
    generate images containing noise with these correlation properties, and generate covariance 
    matrices according to the correlation function.

    scaling of the total variance they represent by scalar factors.

    Convolution of correlation functions with a GSObject is not yet supported, but will be in the 
    near future.

    Initialization
    --------------

    Basic example:

        >>> cf = galsim.ImageCorrFunc(image)

    Instantiates an ImageCorrFunc using the pixel scale information contained in image.getScale()
    (assumes the scale is unity if image.getScale() <= 0.)

    Optional Inputs
    ---------------

        >>> cf = galsim.ImageCorrFunc(image, dx=0.2)

    The example above instantiates an ImageCorrFunc, but forces the use of the pixel scale `dx` to
    set the units of the internal lookup table.

        >>> cf = galsim.ImageCorrFunc(image,
        ...     interpolant=galsim.InterpolantXY(galsim.Lanczos(5, tol=1.e-4))

    The example above instantiates a ImageCorrFunc, but forces the use of a non-default interpolant
    for interpolation of the internal lookup table.  Must be an InterpolantXY instance or an
    Interpolant instance (if the latter one-dimensional case is supplied an InterpolantXY will be
    automatically generated from it).

    The default interpolant if `None` is set is a galsim.InterpolantXY(galsim.Linear(tol=1.e-4)),
    which uses bilinear interpolation.  Initial tests indicate the favourable performance of this
    interpolant in applications involving correlated pixel noise.

    Methods
    -------
    The main way that ImageCorrFunc is used is to add or assign correlated noise to an image.
    This is done with

        cf.applyNoiseTo(im)

    The correlation function is calculated from its pixel values using the NumPy FFT functions.
    Optionally, the pixel scale for the input `image` can be specified using the `dx` keyword
    argument.  See the .applyNoiseTo() method docstring for more information.

    If `dx` is not set the value returned by `image.getScale()` is used unless this is <= 0, in
    which case a scale of 1 is assumed.

    Another method that may be of use is

        cf.calculateCovarianceMatrix(im.bounds, dx)

    which can be used to generate a covariance matrix based on a user input image geometry.  See
    the .calculateCovarianceMatrix() method docstring for more information.

    A number of methods familiar from GSObject instance have also been implemented directly as 
    `cf` methods, so that the following commands are all legal:

        cf.draw(im, dx, wmult=4)
        cf.createSheared(s)
        cf.createMagnified(m)
        cf.createRotated(theta * galsim.degrees)
        cf.createTransformed(ellipse)
        cf.applyShear(s)
        cf.applyMagnification(m)
        cf.applyRotation(theta * galsim.degrees)
        cf.applyTransformation(ellipse)

    See the individual method docstrings for more details.

    A new method, which is in fact a more appropriately named reimplmentation of the
    .scaleFlux() method in GSObject instances, is

        cf.scaleVariance(variance_ratio)

    which scales the overall correlation function, and therefore its total variance, by a scalar
    factor `variance_ratio`.

    Arithmetic Operators
    --------------------
    Addition, multiplication and division operators are defined to work in an intuitive way for
    correlation functions.

    Addition works simply to add the internally-stored correlation functions, so that

        >>> cf2 = cf0 + cf1
        >>> cf2 += cf1

    provides a representation of the correlation function of two linearly summed fields represented
    by the individual correlation function operands.

    The multiplication and division operators scale the overall correlation function by a scalar 
    operand, using the .scaleVariance() method described above.
