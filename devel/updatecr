# Typical usage:
#
# Copy the old copyright notice to oldcr, and the new one to newcr.
# You can grab the canonical text from GalSim_License_statement.txt.
#
# Then type things like the following:
#
#     ls ../*/*.py | updatecr
#
# Use the # version for *.py, *.yaml, and use the /**/ version for *.h, *.cpp.
#
# After you've finished the obvious cases, it's a good idea to check
# that you didn't miss anything with lines like
#
#     grep Copyright */*/* | grep 2019
#
# Also do `git diff` before committing to make sure you didn't mess up any
# files that didn't have a copyright at the start.  You should only see
# lines where the year changed.
#
# There are a few other random things that may be easier to update manually.
# Especially when the copyright notice doesn't start on the first line (this
# file for example).  Also, don't forget to update the docstring in __init__.py
# and the license in doxypy.py

# Count how many lines to remove
