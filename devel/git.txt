--- Quick reference for working with git ---

The internet is full of resources on doing various things with git, but we've included a brief
synopsis of the most important commands here.

Much of this has been lifted from Mario Juric's excellent LSST git tutorial, which can be found in
full here:

http://lsstdev.ncsa.uiuc.edu/trac/wiki/GitDemoAndTutorial

Before you start, you'll probably want to put the following in ~/.gitconfig:

[user]
      name = Your Name
      email = user@domain
[push]
      default = tracking

The "push" section changes the default behavior of "git push" to operate on the current branch only,
which makes it symmetric with "git pull", and will help you avoid confusing (but ultimately
harmless) error messages about failing to push refs due to non-fast-forward merges on branches other
than the current one.  Even more important, it means that "git push" won't push some changes
you've made on a different branch that aren't ready to go public yet.

Some other lines you might want to add:

[color]
    ui = auto                   # Make git status and such more colorful
[alias]
    st = status                 # Make aliases for anything you want to be shorter
    br = branch -a --no-merged  # MJ - I find this one convenient
    ci = commit                 # For those used to cvs...
    co = checkout
[core]
    editor = vim                # or emacs


--- Basic workflow ---

When working on GalSim collaboratively via Github, we broadly employ "Github-flow":
see http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html

In particular, paraphrasing from the article above:

* Anything in the master branch is deployable.

* To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of master (ie: #ISSUE_NUMBER).

* Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server.

* When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a pull request.

* After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you can merge it into master.

* Once it is merged and pushed to master, you can and should deploy immediately.

So far, this system has proved to be very convenient for in depth code review, with hundreds of
successful Pull Requests to date.

Here are some step-by-step examples of using this flow with the command line git tools:

# 0. clone the repo (only need to do this once, of course)
    git clone git@github.com:GalSim-developers/GalSim.git

# 1. check which branch you are on, mostly like you want to be on the master branch
    git branch

# 2. create new branch for issue X, both locally and remotely
    git checkout -b #X
    git push -u origin #X

# 3. do work, commit often, push periodically
... do work ...
    git commit -a
    git push

# 4. when the issue work is complete, you are ready to consider a Pull Request

You can do this via the Github web interface, which in the absence of conflicts will also be able
to handle the eventual merge.  When opening a Pull Request, write a description of the changes on
your branch and why you would like to merge it into master.  Then just wait for people to review
your work!


--- Initial configuration ---

(If you explicitly made your ~/.gitconfig file as described above, you can skip
 this section.)

# Configure your name; this will appear in commits
git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"

# Configure you e-mail; this will appear in commits
git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"

# Use colors if terminal is capable
git config --global color.ui true

# Make 'git push' push only the current branch, and not all of them (probably won't matter, but
# git's default behavior is confusing)
git config --global push.default tracking

--- Add a new file ---

echo '# New build system!' > CMakeList.txt
git status                  # See the status of files in the working directory
git status -s               # The same in format familiar to SVN users
git add CMakeList.txt       # Add a new file to be tracked by git
git status
git commit                  # Commit the changes (the file addition)
git log

--- Editing a file ---

echo '#more stuff' >> CMakeList.txt   # Change the file
git status                            # See that the file is now "dirty"
git diff                              # See the changes
git commit -a                         # Commit all changes (don't forget the -a!)

# You can also use "git add" and "git commit" separately, to only commit some of the files you've
# made changes to.  This is called the "staging area", and it makes it easier to make your commits
# more atomic and meaningful, which makes it easer to use the logs and fix merge conflicts.

--- Branches ---

git branch                 # Show the branch we're on
git branch -a              # List all the branches
git branch -a --no-merged  # List all branches that aren't merged into master yet.

git checkout -b mybranch   # make a new branch and check it out
git checkout mybranch      # checkout an existing branch

# checking out a branch that wasn't created locally
git fetch                           # sync with remote repositories (pull does this too)
git checkout -t origin/otherbranch  # make a "tracking branch" and check it out

# With recent versions of git, you can also just say "git checkout otherbranch" as an equivalent of
# the last line (it won't work at all for earlier versions, so it's safe to try).

--- About Tracking and Remote Branches ---

When you do a "git fetch", git gets all the changes in the repository you cloned from.  That repo is
called "origin", and it's what git calls a "remote".  You can have multiple remotes if you like, or
change their names (see "git remote --help"), but most of the time you'll just deal with origin.
Anyhow, when you fetch, the branches in the remote repository are synced into local branches with
names like "origin/master" and "origin/someotherbranch".  These are "remote branches", and you
should never check them out directly.

Instead, you make a local branch that "tracks" the remote branch, with
"git push -u <remote>" (if you made the branch) or
"git checkout -t <remote>/<branch>" (if someone else did), as above.
A tracking branch tells git where to push your changes when you say "git push", and where to pull
from when you say "git pull".  In fact, "git pull" is basically equivalent to doing "git fetch"
(which puts remote changes into the remote branches) and "git merge <remote>" (which merges the
remote branch into the tracking branch).

--- About the impact of how we chose branch names ---

We chose our branch names such that they start with #.  This has an impact if we have local
tracking branches that we want to delete.  Say, for example, that we want to make a tracking branch
for #12.  As above, this can be done using

git checkout -t origin/#12

When we use "branch" to check what branches we have, we will have a #12 on the list.  But let's say
branch #12 gets merged to master and we no longer want the tracking branch sitting around.  If we do

git branch -d #12

then nothing will happen because either git or the shell is trying to interpret the #.  We have to
say

git branch -d "#12"

to get the tracking branch to go away.  The quotes are necessary whenever the # appears
at the beginning of a word:

git checkout '#12'
git merge '#12'

To add the branch name in this format to each commit message, automatically (this is useful for
getting commits listed on Github issue pages), see the file commit-msg in this directory.

--- Tags ---

We will be creating tags corresponding to all completed milestones and code releases.  By default,
these should be annotated tags (which include more information).  These tags are created using

git tag -a TAGNAME -m MESSAGE

and are pushed to the repository using

git push --tags

To use a code version corresponding to some tag, you can use

git checkout TAGNAME

To list all tags, use

git tag -l

and to get information about some particular tag, use

git show TAGNAME

NOTE: when you go to the code version corresponding to some tag, you may get a message warning you
that you have a detached HEAD.  This is okay; it means that git doesn't know what to do if you make
a commit (i.e., you're not on any branch).  But, by definition, we should not be changing tagged
versions; we should be working on specific branches, so this warning is not a problem.

--- Deleting branches on the origin ---

PLEASE NOTE: We have not decided any policy about cleaning up old branches on the origin yet, so
please do not use this for deleting branches that have been successfully merged into the master
branch.  Use it only for cleanup jobs, as in Issue #122.

The rather obtuse syntax for deleting a branch on the origin uses a push command as follows:

git push origin :"branchname"

or for a direct example:

git push origin :"#36_Image_unit_tests"

using the case in Issue #122 of wishing to remove a branch named #36_Image_unit_tests from the 
origin.  

Note in that in Issue #122 this usage led to the removal of the branch name for the commits
associated with the work done in #36_Image_unit_tests, highlighting why Barney made a mistake in
creating a new branch for an old Issue that already had one.

--- What happens if you make a huge mess while working locally? ---

If you have made a mess with some local commits (for example, committed something to the wrong
branch), then there are ways to fix it.  For example:

git reset --hard <commit> allows you to set a branch to any commit, and <commit> can be a lot of
different things. For instance, if you want to set your version of master to whatever the remote one
is, do git reset --hard origin/master while on your master. If you want to totally remove the last
two commits, you can do git reset --hard HEAD~2.

git commit --amend is another neat trick that lets you modify the last commit, and you can edit
history even further back with git rebase -i.

Again, this should only be done if you haven't pushed the changes.

--- Putting git status info in your prompt ---

This is a cute little trick from Paul Price.  Many people like to have the directory they are
in as part of their prompt to help keep track of where they are in their directory structure.
Since git always uses the same directory structure for different branches, rather than using 
different directories a la svn, it can sometimes be hard to remember which branch you are on.

Paul Price developed a trick to get the git branch as part of the prompt as well, and I 
(Jarvis) have found it very useful.  (It doesn't do anything to your prompt when you
aren't in a git directory.)  Here is what to put in your .bashrc or .bash_profile file:

function prompt_git_dirty {
  local gitstat=`git status 2> /dev/null`
  local charstat=""
  [[ -z $(echo $gitstat | grep "nothing to commit (working directory clean)") ]] && charstat="\*"
  [[ -n $(echo $gitstat | grep "Your branch and '.*' have diverged") ]] && echo "${charstat}\%" && return
  [[ -n $(echo $gitstat | grep 'Your branch is ahead of') ]] && echo "${charstat}+" && return 
  [[ -n $(echo $gitstat | grep 'Your branch is behind') ]] && echo "${charstat}-" && return
  echo $charstat
}

function prompt_git_branch {
  git branch --no-color 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e "s/* \(.*\)/[\1$(prompt_git_dirty)]/"
}

Then just add $(prompt_git_branch) where you want it in your prompt.  e.g. Here is mine:

PS1='\[\033[01;34m\]\u@\h\[\033[00;30m\]:\w\[\033[00;31m\]$(prompt_git_branch) \[\033[00m\]\$ '

An example prompt is (ignoring the colors):

Mike@flute:~/GalSim[#107+] $

The '+' after the #107 means that I have commits that haven't been pushed yet.  If I have 
changes that haven't been committed, it will be a '*':

Mike@flute:~/GalSim[#107*] $

When the working directory is clean, it just shows

Mike@flute:~/GalSim[#107] $

If you've fetched changes from the repository, but haven't merged them, you get a '-'.  And
if you have unpushed commit and unmerged upstream commits (which means you might be getting
into trouble in the future), you get a '%'.

This is obviously completely optional, but I've found it pretty helpful when using git.

Note: Paul gives due credit, saying he "stole the idea and much of the implementation from 
http://rubyglazed.com/post/15772234418/git-ify-your-command-line."

Finally, I discovered that after a while of using git, the command prompt started to get a bit
slow.  It turns out the 'git gc --aggressive' cleaned out a lot of the junk and made it run 
much faster again.
