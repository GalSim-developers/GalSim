"""test_cf_interpolant.py:  Make upsampled plots of correlation functions to see how their
interpolants behave.

A simple script used to quickly generate plots for the discussion of which interpolant should be
used to describe correlation functions.  See the discussion at
https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim/pull/452#discussion-diff-5701561
