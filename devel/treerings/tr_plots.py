tr_plot.py

Modifying demo5.py to create arrays of Gaussian spots
for characterizing the tree rings

- Build a single large image, and access sub-images within it.
- Set the galaxy size based on the PSF size and a resolution factor.
- Set the object's flux according to a target S/N value.
- Shift by a random (dx, dy) drawn from a unit circle top hat.
