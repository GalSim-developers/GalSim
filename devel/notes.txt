Checklist for making a new release:

For new major or minor releases:

- Run test suite on as many machines as possible.
- On each machine, run:
  - python setup.py test
  - run_all_tests (in tests directory. go get some coffee...)
  - check_yaml (in examples directory)
  - check_json (in examples directory)
  - check_des (in examples directory)
- Update any docs that might need updating.
- Make the release branch for the new minor version.
    git checkout -b releases/M.m
    git push -u origin releases/M.m

For all releases:

- Update the version number to the new M.m.r value in galsim/_version.py
- Read over the CHANGELOG.rst file and edit as needed.
- Make sure the current code is installed:
    python setup.py install
- Generate current docs
    ./update_docs
- Commit and push new docs.
    git add docs/_build
    git commit -m "update docs"
    git push
