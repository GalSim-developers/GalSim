"""
The purpose of this script is to take data from assorted GREAT3-related files that store data about
the COSMOS galaxies and their parametric fits, and combine them into a single file that GalSim will
use to make cuts in the COSMOSCatalog class.

Set up to point to data that live in a particular spot, so likely nobody else can actually run this
script.
