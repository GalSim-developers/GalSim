class ComparisonShapeData(object):
    """A class to contain the outputs of a comparison between photon shooting and DFT rendering of
    GSObjects, as measured by the HSM module's FindAdaptiveMom or (in future) EstimateShear.

    Currently this class contains the following attributes (see also the ShapeData
    documentation for a more detailed description of, e.g., `observed_shape`, `moments_sigma`)
    describing the results of the comparison:

    - g1obs_draw: `observed_shape.g1` from adaptive moments on a GSObject image rendered using
      .draw()

    - g2obs_draw: `observed_shape.g2` from adaptive moments on a GSObject image rendered using
      .draw()

    - g1hsm_draw: `corrected_shape.g1` from adaptive moments on a GSObject image rendered using
      .draw()

    - g2hsm_draw: `corrected_shape.g2` from adaptive moments on a GSObject image rendered using
      .draw()

    - sigma_draw: `moments_sigma` from adaptive moments on a GSObject image rendered using .draw()

    - sighs_draw: `moments_sigma` from HSM PSF correction on a GSObject image rendered using .draw()

    - delta_g1obs: estimated mean difference between i) `observed_shape.g1` from images of the same
      GSObject rendered with .drawShoot(), and ii) `g1obs_draw`.
      Defined `delta_g1obs = g1obs_draw - g1obs_shoot`.

    - delta_g2obs: estimated mean difference between i) `observed_shape.g2` from images of the same
      GSObject rendered with .drawShoot(), and ii) `g1obs_draw`.
      Defined `delta_g2obs = g2obs_draw - g2obs_shoot`.

    - delta_g1hsm: estimated mean difference between i) `observed_shape.g1` from images of the same
      GSObject rendered with .drawShoot(), and ii) `g1hsm_draw`.
      Defined `delta_g1hsm = g1hsm_draw - g1hsm_shoot`.

    - delta_g2hsm: estimated mean difference between i) `observed_shape.g2` from images of the same
      GSObject rendered with .drawShoot(), and ii) `g1hsm_draw`.
      Defined `delta_g2hsm = g2hsm_draw - g2hsm_shoot`.

    - delta_sigma: estimated mean difference between i) `moments_sigma` from images of the same
      GSObject rendered with .drawShoot(), and ii) `sigma_draw`.
      Defined `delta_sigma = sigma_draw - sigma_shoot`.

    - delta_sighs: estimated mean difference between i) `moments_sigma` from images of the same
      GSObject rendered with .drawShoot(), and ii) `sigma_draw`. 
      Defined `delta_sigma = sigma_draw - sigma_shoot`. Moments calculated using HSM PSF corr.

    - err_g1obs: standard error in `delta_g1obs` estimated from the test sample.

    - err_g2obs: standard error in `delta_g2obs` estimated from the test sample.

    - err_g1hsm: standard error in `delta_g1hsm` estimated from the test sample.

    - err_g2hsm: standard error in `delta_g2hsm` estimated from the test sample.

    - err_sigma: standard error in `delta_sigma` estimated from the test sample.

    - err_sighs: standard error in `delta_sigma` estimated from the test sample using HSM PSF corr.

    The ComparisonShapeData instance also stores much of the meta-information about the tests:

    - gsobject: the galsim.GSObject for which this test was performed (prior to PSF convolution if
      a PSF was also supplied).

    - psf_object: the optional additional PSF supplied by the user for tests of convolved objects,
      will be `None` if not used.

    - size: the size of the images tested - all test images are currently square.

    - pixel_scale: the pixel scale in the images tested.

    - wmult: the `wmult` parameter used in .draw() (see the GSObject .draw() method docs for more
      details).

    - n_iterations: number of iterations of `n_trials` trials required to get delta quantities to
      the above accuracy.

    - n_trials_per_iter: number of trial images used to estimate or successively re-estimate the
      standard error on the delta quantities above for each iteration.

    - n_photons_per_trial: number of photons shot in drawShoot() for each trial.

    - time: the time taken to perform the test.

    Note this is really only a simple storage container for the results above.  All of the
    non trivial calculation is completed before a ComparisonShapeData instance is initialized,
    typically in the function compare_object_dft_vs_photon().

    - gsobject: optional GSObject for which this test was performed (prior to PSF convolution
      if a PSF was also supplied).

    - psf_object: the optional additional PSF supplied by the user for tests of convolved objects,
      will be `None` if not used.

    - config: optional config object describing the GSObject and PSF if the config comparison script
      was used rather than the (single core only) direct object script.

    Either `config`, or `gsobject`, or `gsobject` and `psf_object`, must be set when a
    ComparisonShapeData instance is created, or an Exception is raised.

    """Take an input object (with optional PSF) and render it in two ways comparing results at high
    precision.

    Using both photon shooting (via drawShoot()) and Discrete Fourier Transform (via draw()) to
    render images, we compare the numerical values of adaptive moments estimates of size and
    ellipticity to check consistency.

    This function takes actual GSObjects as its input, but because these are not yet picklable this
    means that the internals cannot be parallelized using the Python multiprocessing module.  For
    a parallelized function, that instead uses a config dictionary to specify the test objects, see
    the function compare_dft_vs_photon_config() in this module.

    We generate successive sets of `n_trials_per_iter` photon-shot images, using 
    `n_photons_per_trial` photons in each image, until the standard error on the mean absolute size
    and ellipticity drop below `abs_tol_size` and `abs_tol_ellip`.  We then output a
    ComparisonShapeData object which stores the results.

    Note that `n_photons_per_trial` should be large (>~ 1e6) to ensure that any biases detected
    between the photon shooting and DFT-drawn images are due to numerical differences rather than
    biases on adaptive moments due to noise itself, a generic feature in this work.  This can be
    verified with a convergence test.

    @param gsobject         The GSObject for which this test is to be performed (prior
                            to PSF convolution if a PSF is also supplied via `psf_object`).
                            Note that this function will automatically handle integration over
                            a Pixel of width `pixel_scale`, so a Pixel should not be included in
                            the supplied `gsobject` (unless you really mean to include it, which
                            will be very rare in normal usage).
    @param psf_object       Optional additional PSF for tests of convolved objects, also a
                            GSObject.  Note that this function will automatically handle
                            integration over a Pixel of width `pixel_scale`, so this should not
                            be included in the supplied `psf_object`.  [default: None]

                            are currently square. [default: 512]

                            method docs via `help(galsim.GSObject.draw)` for more details).
                            [default: 4]
    @param abs_tol_ellip    The test will keep iterating, adding ever greater numbers of
                            trials, until estimates of the 1-sigma standard error on mean 
                            ellipticity moments from photon-shot images are smaller than this
                            param value. [default: 1.e-5]
    @param abs_tol_size     The test will keep iterating, adding ever greater numbers of
                            trials, until estimates of the 1-sigma standard error on mean 
                            size moments from photon-shot images are smaller than this param
                            value. [default: 1.e-5]
    @param n_trials_per_iter  Number of trial images used to estimate (or successively
                            re-estimate) the standard error on the delta quantities above for
                            each iteration of the tests. [default: 32]
    @param n_photons_per_trial  Number of photons shot in drawShoot() for each trial.  This should
                            be large enough that any noise bias (a.k.a. noise rectification
                            bias) on moments estimates is small. [default: 1e7]
    @param moments          Set True to compare rendered images using AdaptiveMoments
                            estimates of simple observed estimates. [default: True]

    For both cases there should be no randomly selected parameters in the galaxy and PSF config 
    specification. 

    For an example of defining a config dictionary of the sort suitable for input to this function,
    see examples/demo8.py in the GalSim repository.

    Using both photon shooting (via drawShoot()) and Discrete Fourier Transform (via draw()) to
    render images, we compare the numerical values of adaptive moments estimates of ellipticity
    and size to check consistency.

    We generate successive sets of `n_trials_per_iter` photon-shot images, using 
    `n_photons_per_trial` photons in each image, until the standard error on the mean absolute size
    and ellipticty drop below `abs_tol_size` and `abs_tol_ellip`.  We then output a
    ComparisonShapeData object which stores the results.

    Note that `n_photons_per_trial` should be large (>~ 1e6) to ensure that any biases detected
    between the photon shooting and DFT-drawn images are due to numerical differences rather than
    biases on adaptive moments due to noise itself, a generic feature in this work.  This can be
    verified with a convergence test.

    @param config           GalSim config dictionary describing the GSObject we wish to test
                            (see e.g. examples/demo8.py).
    @param gal_num          Number for the galaxy in the config dictionary, which will be 
                            passed to the config system. It relates to `obj_num` in the config
                            system by obj_num = gal_num * n_trials_per_iter (assuming the
                            config is created correctly as explained in the example above)
                            [default: 0]
    @param random_seed      Integer to be used as the basis of all seeds for the random number
                            generator, overrides any value in config['image']. [default: None]
    @param nproc            Number of cpu processes to run in parallel, overrides any value
                            in config['image']. [default: None]
    @param pixel_scale      The pixel scale to use in the test images, overrides any value in
                            config['image']. [default: None]
    @param size             The size of the images in the rendering tests - all test images
                            are currently square, overrides any value in config['image'].
                            [default: None]
    @param wmult            The `wmult` parameter used in .draw() (see the GSObject .draw()
                            method docs via `help(galsim.GSObject.draw)` for more details),
                            overrides any value in config['image']. [default: None]
    @param abs_tol_ellip    The test will keep iterating, adding ever greater numbers of
                            trials, until estimates of the 1-sigma standard error on mean 
                            ellipticity moments from photon-shot images are smaller than this
                            param value. If `moments=False`, then using the measurements 
                            from HSM. [default: 1.e-5]
    @param abs_tol_size     The test will keep iterating, adding ever greater numbers of
                            trials, until estimates of the 1-sigma standard error on mean 
                            size moments from photon-shot images are smaller than this param
                            value. If `moments=False`, then using the measurements 
                            from HSM. [default: 1.e-5]
    @param n_trials_per_iter  Number of trial images used to estimate (or successively
                            re-estimate) the standard error on the delta quantities above for
                            each iteration of the tests. [default: 32]
    @param n_max_iter       Maximum number of iterations. After reaching it, the current
                            uncertainty on shape measurement is reported, even if
                            `abs_tol_ellip` and `abs_tol_size` was not reached. If a negative
                            number is supplied, then there is no limit on number of 
                            iterations. [default: -1]
    @param n_photons_per_trial  Number of photons shot in drawShoot() for each trial.  This should
                            be large enough that any noise bias (a.k.a. noise rectification
                            bias) on moments estimates is small. [default: 1e7]
    @param moments          Set True to compare rendered images using FindAdaptiveMoment()
                            estimates of simple observed estimates. [default: True]
    @param hsm              Should the rendered images be compared using HSM shear estimates?
                            (i.e. including a PSF correction for shears) [default: False]
    @param logger           Logging Logger instance to record output and pass down to the
                            config layer for debuging / verbose output if desired. [default: None]
