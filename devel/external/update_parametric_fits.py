"""
In GalSim v1.3, the COSMOSCatalog() class defined in scene.py has to do many calculations (some
expensive) to convert the stored information about parametric galaxy fits into GSObjects.  For
GalSim v1.4, we would like to avoid the need to do those calculations each time, so this script is
meant to precompute all those quantities and store them in the file with the parametric fits.  This
way they can simply be read in.

Set up to point to data that live in a particular spot, so likely nobody else can actually run this
script.

#     SERSICFIT[2]: Sersic n.
#     SERSICFIT[3]: q, the ratio of minor axis to major axis length.
#     SERSICFIT[4]: boxiness, currently fixed to 0, meaning isophotes are all
