"""Program 7
Script to add WEIGHT factors to galaxies to account for any selection bias
when making the final catalog. The fraction of galaxies that are included in
the final catalog compared to the parent catalog was measured as a function
of several parameters like FLUX_RADIUS, ELLIPTICITY, MAGNITUDE etc., to check
for selection bias. The distribution was observed to show a dependance on the
half light radius of the galaxy measured by SExtractor. The weight is defined
as the ratio of the number of galaxies in the parent sample to the number in
the final catalog, at a given half light radius. Due to the small number of
galaxies at high half light radius in the parent sample, this definition
breaks down. Thus weight for large galaxies is set to 1, and the weights of
other galaxies were renormalized.
Since the magnitude cut in the parent sample was placed in the I band, the
weight for each galxy was computed in this band and set the same for all other
bands.
