# This is written as a unit test, since I originally conceived of this as a better test of
# ChromaticOpticalPSF photon shooting than the artificial one in test_chromatic.py.
# However, it's super slow.  The FFT takes 17 seconds and the photon shooting takes 7 seconds.
# So this is not going to be sufficient for an efficient implementation
