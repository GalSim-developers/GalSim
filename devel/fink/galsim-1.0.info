CompileScript: <<

    # Note: The above two parameters should mean that the MAKEFILES 
    # environment variable only has '-jN'.  This has the same meaning for 
    # scons, but scons doesn't use MAKEFLAGS, so put it here explicitly.

InstallScript: <<

    # Use -j1 to prevent Scons script from automatically detecting and using 
    # the number of cpus 
    scons install -j1

    # We delete the unversioned symlink since we don't actually want any other packages
    # linking this file, so this helps to discourage that.
    rm %i/lib/libgalsim.dylib

    # This is still called libgalsim.0.dylib, as it was for the 0.x versions, but it should be 
    # libgalsim.1.dylib now that we are version 1.0.  TODO: Fix this in SConscript file.
    mv %i/lib/libgalsim.0.dylib %i/lib/libgalsim.1.dylib

    # Fix the error in the install_name produced by SCons.  
    # TODO: Make SCons do this correctly, so this fix isn't necessary.
    install_name_tool -id %p/lib/libgalsim.1.dylib %i/lib/libgalsim.1.dylib

    # Point the python module to the now correctly named dynamic library.
    # Some versions of scons (e.g. 2.3) leave binaries linked to %b, while others
    # (e.g. 2.0) relink to %p during the Install phase.  TODO: Fix this.
    # TODO: Also fix the compatibility version in src/SConscript to match galsim version.
    # The install_name_tool command fails silently when it doesn't find the name it's looking for,
    # so we can just do both of these commands, and one of them will work.
    install_name_tool -change %p/lib/libgalsim.0.dylib %p/lib/libgalsim.1.dylib %i/lib/python2.7/site-packages/galsim/_galsim.so
    install_name_tool -change %b/lib/libgalsim.0.dylib %p/lib/libgalsim.1.dylib %i/lib/python2.7/site-packages/galsim/_galsim.so
