CompileScript: <<

    # Note: The above two parameters should mean that the MAKEFILES 
    # environment variable only has '-jN'.  This has the same meaning for 
    # scons, but scons doesn't use MAKEFLAGS, so put it here explicitly.

InstallScript: <<

    # Use -j1 to prevent Scons script from automatically detecting and using 
    # the number of cpus 
    scons install -j1

    # We delete the unversioned symlink since we don't actually want any other packages
    # linking this file, so this helps to discourage that.
