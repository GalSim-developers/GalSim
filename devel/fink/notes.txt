Process for updating fink with a new version:

- Download the tagged tarball from GitHub.
- Get the md5sum value for it.
- Update the galsim.info file with the new URL and new Source-MD5 value.
  (I keep these named by version number, but fink likes them as just galsim.info.)
- Make sure the SourceRename value matches the directory name in the tarball.
- Update /sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo/galsim.info link to point to new info file.
- fink validate galsim.info
- fink -m --build-as-nobody rebuild galsim
- dpkg -c /sw/fink/debs/galsim_[...].deb
- fink validate /sw/fink/debs/galsim_[...].deb
- fink install galsim
- Check that otool -L /sw/lib/libgalsim[...].dylib has the right version number and directory.
= otool -L /sw/lib/python2.7/site-packages/galsim/_galsim.so
- Make sure check_yaml works if you set python to /sw/bin/python2.7 and bin to /sw/bin
- In tests directory run /sw/bin/nosetests2.7
- git add new info file for this version.
- Submit to: http://sourceforge.net/p/fink/package-submissions/
  - Don't forget to change the name to galsim.info (without the version number).
  - Milestone = Undergoing Validation
  - Status = open
  - Mention that you have done the above tests.
