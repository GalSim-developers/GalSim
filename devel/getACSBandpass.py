Grab HST ACS bandpasses from the web, and then thin with rel_err = 1.e-3.  Note that the outputs of
this script, which are the files GALSIM_DIR/share/bandpasses/ACS*.dat, are already included in the
repository.  This script just lets users know where these files came from and how they were altered.
