Modifying demo5.py to create 10 x 10 arrays of Gaussian spots
for characterizing the B-F effect
Craig Lage - 20-Oct-17
This version tests the writing out of the photon list.
and uses the latest pixel distortion maps from the
latest 'hole20' branch of the Poisson_CCD22 code

- Build a single large image, and access sub-images within it.
- Set the galaxy size based on the PSF size and a resolution factor.
- Set the object's flux according to a target S/N value.
- Shift by a random (dx, dy) drawn from a unit circle top hat.
