=========================

With this release, we are no longer supporting Python 2.7 or 3.6.
GalSim is supported for the following Python versions: 3.7, 3.8, 3.9.
[MJ: Note: I fully expect to include 3.10 in the mix by the time we release this.]

.. note::

    As advertised in the 2.3 release notes, GalSim no longer supports the
    following legacy options:

    * Python 2
    * TMV for matrices in C++
    * Boost Python for C++ bindings
