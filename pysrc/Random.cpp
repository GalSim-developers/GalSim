/*
 * Barney's note 24Mar12: currently these only generate single instances of each random deviate.
 * This is not optimized for generating large arrays of random deviates.  I spoke with Jim and we 
 * thought that it would be best to write this in C++, but Barney needs to learn a little more about
 * the Numpy C API.  For now, we'll have to fill in arrays in Python manually; hopefully only a 
 * temporary workaround.
