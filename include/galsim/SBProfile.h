     * @brief A base class representing all of the 2D surface brightness profiles that

     *
     * Every SBProfile knows how to draw an Image<float> of itself in real and k space.  Each also
     * knows what is needed to prevent aliasing or truncation of itself when drawn.
     * **Note** that when you use the SBProfile::draw() routines you will get an image of 
     * **surface brightness** values in each pixel, not the flux that fell into the pixel.  To get
     * flux, you must multiply the image by (dx*dx).
     * drawK() routines are normalized such that I(0,0) is the total flux.
     * Currently we have the following possible implementations of SBProfile:
     * Basic shapes: SBBox, SBGaussian, SBExponential, SBAiry, SBSersic
     * SBLaguerre: Gauss-Laguerre expansion
     * SBTransform: affine transformation of another SBProfile
     * SBAdd: sum of SBProfiles
     * SBConvolve: convolution of other SBProfiles
     * SBInterpolatedImage: surface brightness profiles defined by an image and interpolant.
     * SBDeconvolve: deconvolve one SBProfile with another
     *
     * This isn't an abstract base class.  An SBProfile is a concrete object
     * which internally has a pointer to the implementation details (which _is_ an abstract
     * base class).  Furthermore, all SBProfiles are immutable objects.  Any changes
     * are made through modifiers that return a new object.  (e.g. setFlux,
     * shear, shift, etc.)  This means that we can safely make SBProfiles use shallow
     * copies, since that will never be confusing, which in turn means that SBProfiles
     * can be safely returned by value, used in containers (e.g. list<SBProfile>), etc.
     *
     * The only constructor for SBProfile is the copy constructor.  All SBProfiles need
     * to be created as one of the derived types that have real constructors.
     *
     * Well, technically, there is also a default constructor to make it easier to use
     * containers of SBProfiles.  However, it is an error to use an SBProfile that
     * has been default constructed for any purpose. 
     *
     * The assignment operator does a shallow copy, replacing the current contents of
     * the SBProfile with that of the rhs profile.

         * of the total object flux, so do not assume that there will be sqrt(N) error on the flux.
         * In fact most implementations will return a PhotonArray with exactly correct flux, with
         * only the *distribution* of flux on the sky that will definitely have sampling noise.
         *
         * The one definitive gaurantee is that, in the limit of large number of photons, the
         * surface brightness distribution of the photons will converge on the SB pattern defined by
         * the object.

         * Objects with regions of negative flux will result in creation of photons with negative
         * flux.  Absolute value of negative photons' flux should be nearly equal to the standard
         * flux of positive photons.  Shot-noise fluctuations between the number of positive and
         * negative photons will produce noise in the total net flux carried by the output

         * distribution of the *absolute value* of flux.  If a photon is drawn from a region of
         * negative flux, then that photon's flux is negated.  Because of cancellation, this means
         * that each photon will carry more than `getFlux()/N` flux if there are negative-flux
         * regions in the object.  It also means that during convolution, addition, or

         * than you would expect if you had only positive-flux photons.
         *
         * The photon flux may also vary slightly as a means of speeding up photon-shooting, as an
         * alternative to rejection sampling.  See `OneDimensionalDeviate` documentation.
         *
