    /**
     * @brief A base class representing all of the 2D surface brightness profiles that we know how
     * to draw.
     *
     * The SBProfile class is a representation of a surface brightness distribution across a
     * 2-dimensional image plane, with real and/or Fourier-domain models of a wide variety of galaxy
     * shapes, point-spread functions (PSFs), and their convolutions.  There are several
     * realizations of the SBProfile classes: There are the "atomic" classes that represent specific
     * analytic profiles: (SBDeltaFunction, SBGaussian, SBSersic, SBAiry, SBExponential, SBBox,
     * SBDeVaucouleurs and SBMoffat). SBInterpolatedImage represents a pattern defined by a grid of
     * pixel values and a chosen interpolation scheme between pixel centers.  SBTransform represents
     * any affine transformation (shear, magnification, rotation, translation, and/or flux
     * rescaling) of any other SBProfile. SBAdd represents the sum of any number of SBProfiles.
     * SBConvolve represents the convolution of any number of SBProfiles, and SBDeconvolve is the
     * deconvolution of one SBProfile with another.
     *
     * Every SBProfile knows how to draw an Image<float> of itself in real and k space.  Each also
     * knows what is needed to prevent aliasing or truncation of itself when drawn.  The classes
     * model the surface brightness of the object, so the xValue routine returns the value of the
     * surface brightness at a given point.  Usually we define this as flux/arcsec^2.
     *
     * However, when drawing an SBProfile, any distance measures used to define the SBProfile will
     * be taken to be in units of pixels.  Thus the image, which is nominally a **surface
     * brightness** image is also a **flux** image.  The flux in each pixel is the flux/pixel^2.
     * The python layer takes care of the typical case of defining an SBProfile in terms of arcsec,
     * then converting the image to pixels (scaling the size and flux appropriately), so that the
     * draw command here has the correct flux.
     *
     * This isn't an abstract base class.  An SBProfile is a concrete object which internally has
     * a pointer to the implementation details (which _is_ an abstract base class).  Furthermore,
     * all SBProfiles are immutable objects.  Any changes are made through modifiers that return a
     * new object.  (e.g. setFlux, shear, shift, etc.)  This means that we can safely make
     * SBProfiles use shallow copies, since that will never be confusing, which in turn means that
     * SBProfiles can be safely returned by value, used in containers (e.g. list<SBProfile>), etc.
     *
     * The only constructor for SBProfile is the copy constructor.  All SBProfiles need to be
     * created as one of the derived types that have real constructors.
     *
     * Well, technically, there is also a default constructor to make it easier to use containers
     * of SBProfiles.  However, it is an error to use an SBProfile that has been default
     * constructed for any purpose.
     *
     * The assignment operator does a shallow copy, replacing the current contents of the SBProfile
     * with that of the rhs profile.

         * regions.  Note that the ray-shooting method is not intended to produce a randomized value
         * of the total object flux, so do not assume that there will be sqrt(N) error on the flux.
         * In fact most implementations will return a PhotonArray with exactly correct flux, with
         * only the *distribution* of flux on the sky that will definitely have sampling noise.
         *
         * The one definitive gaurantee is that, in the limit of large number of photons, the
         * surface brightness distribution of the photons will converge on the SB pattern defined by
         * the object.
         *
         * Objects with regions of negative flux will result in creation of photons with negative
         * flux.  Absolute value of negative photons' flux should be nearly equal to the standard
         * flux of positive photons.  Shot-noise fluctuations between the number of positive and
         * negative photons will produce noise in the total net flux carried by the output
         * [PhotonArray](@ref PhotonArray).
         *
         * The typical implementation will be to take the integral of the absolute value of flux,
         * and divide it nearly equally into N photons.  The photons are then drawn from the
         * distribution of the *absolute value* of flux.  If a photon is drawn from a region of
         * negative flux, then that photon's flux is negated.  Because of cancellation, this means
         * that each photon will carry more than `getFlux()/N` flux if there are negative-flux
         * regions in the object.  It also means that during convolution, addition, or
         * interpolation, positive- and negative-flux photons can be contributing to the same region
         * of the image.  Their cancellation means that the shot noise may be substantially higher
         * than you would expect if you had only positive-flux photons.
         *
         * The photon flux may also vary slightly as a means of speeding up photon-shooting, as an
         * alternative to rejection sampling.  See `OneDimensionalDeviate` documentation.
