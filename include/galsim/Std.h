// Convenient debugging.
// Use as a normal C++ stream:
// dbg << "Here x = "<<x<<" and y = "<<y<<std::endl;
// If DEBUGLOGGING is not enabled, the compiler optimizes it away, so it 
// doesn't take any CPU cycles.
//
// You need to define dbgout and verbose_level in the .cpp file with main().
// And if you are using OpenMP, you can get debugging output from each thread into
// a separate file by calling SetupThreadDebug(name).
// Then each thread other than the main thread will actually write to a file 
// name_threadnum and not clobber each other.  (The main thread will write to name.)

    // zero-length strings, such as the one in the default constructor for ostringstream.

    // should print as nothing, so it should have no apparent result, and it avoids the 
    // attempted deallocation of the global empty string.
