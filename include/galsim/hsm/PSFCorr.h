     * @brief Parameters that determine how the moments/shape estimation routines make
     *        speed/accuracy tradeoff decisions.
     *
     * @param nsig_rg            A parameter used to optimize convolutions by cutting off the galaxy
     *                           profile.  In the first step of the re-Gaussianization method of PSF
     *                           correction, a Gaussian approximation to the pre-seeing galaxy is
     *                           calculated. If re-Gaussianization is called with the flag 0x4 (as
     *                           is the default), then this approximation is cut off at nsig_rg
     *                           sigma to save computation time in convolutions.
     * @param nsig_rg2           A parameter used to optimize convolutions by cutting off the PSF
     *                           residual profile.  In the re-Gaussianization method of PSF
     *                           correction, a "PSF residual" (the difference between the true PSF
     *                           and its best-fit Gaussian approximation) is constructed. If
     *                           re-Gaussianization is called with the flag 0x8 (as is the default),
     *                           then this PSF residual is cut off at nsig_rg2 sigma to save
     *                           computation time in convolutions.
     * @param max_moment_nsig2   A parameter for optimizing calculations of adaptive moments by
     *                           cutting off profiles. This parameter is used to decide how many
     *                           sigma^2 into the Gaussian adaptive moment to extend the moment
     *                           calculation, with the weight being defined as 0 beyond this point.
     *                           i.e., if max_moment_nsig2 is set to 25, then the Gaussian is
     *                           extended to (r^2/sigma^2)=25, with proper accounting for elliptical
     *                           geometry.  If this parameter is set to some very large number, then
     *                           the weight is never set to zero and the exponential function is
     *                           always called. Note: GalSim script devel/modules/test_mom_timing.py
     *                           was used to choose a value of 25 as being optimal, in that for the
     *                           cases that were tested, the speedups were typically factors of
     *                           several, but the results of moments and shear estimation were
     *                           changed by <10^-5.  Not all possible cases were checked, and so for
     *                           use of this code for unusual cases, we recommend that users check
     *                           that this value does not affect accuracy, and/or set it to some
     *                           large value to completely disable this optimization.
     * @param regauss_too_small  A parameter for how strictly the re-Gaussianization code treats
     *                           small galaxies. If this parameter is 1, then the re-Gaussianization
     *                           code does not impose a cut on the apparent resolution before trying
     *                           to measure the PSF-corrected shape of the galaxy; if 0, then it is
     *                           stricter.  Using the default value of 1 prevents the
     *                           re-Gaussianization PSF correction from completely failing at the
     *                           beginning, before trying to do PSF correction, due to the crudest
     *                           possible PSF correction (Gaussian approximation) suggesting that
     *                           the galaxy is very small.  This could happen for some usable
     *                           galaxies particularly when they have very non-Gaussian surface
     *                           brightness profiles -- for example, if there's a prominent bulge
     *                           that the adaptive moments attempt to fit, ignoring a more
     *                           extended disk.  Setting a value of 1 is useful for keeping galaxies
     *                           that would have failed for that reason.  If they later turn out to
     *                           be too small to really use, this will be reflected in the final
     *                           estimate of the resolution factor, and they can be rejected after
     *                           the fact.
     * @param adapt_order        The order to which circular adaptive moments should be calculated
     *                           for KSB method. This parameter only affects calculations using the
     *                           KSB method of PSF correction.  Warning: deviating from default
     *                           value of 2 results in code running more slowly, and results have
     *                           not been significantly tested.
     * @param convergence_threshold Accuracy (in x0, y0, and sigma as a fraction of sigma) when
     *                           calculating adaptive moments.
     * @param max_mom2_iter      Maximum number of iterations to use when calculating adaptive
     *                           moments.  This should be sufficient in nearly all situations, with
     *                           the possible exception being very flattened profiles.
     * @param num_iter_default   Number of iterations to report in the output ShapeData structure
     *                           when code fails to converge within max_mom2_iter iterations.
     * @param bound_correct_wt   Maximum shift in centroids and sigma between iterations for
     *                           adaptive moments.
     * @param max_amoment        Maximum value for adaptive second moments before throwing
     *                           exception.  Very large objects might require this value to be
     *                           increased.
     * @param max_ashift         Maximum allowed x / y centroid shift (units: pixels) between
     *                           successive iterations for adaptive moments before throwing
     *                           exception.
     * @param ksb_moments_max    Use moments up to ksb_moments_max order for KSB method of PSF
     *                           correction.
     * @param ksb_sig_weight     The width of the weight function (in pixels) to use for the KSB
     *                           method.  Normally, this is derived from the measured moments of the
     *                           galaxy image; this keyword overrides this calculation.  Can be
     *                           combined with ksb_sig_factor.
     * @param ksb_sig_factor     Factor by which to multiply the weight function width for the KSB
     *                           method (default: 1.0).  Can be combined with ksb_sig_weight.
     * @param failed_moments     Value to report for ellipticities and resolution factor if shape
     *                           measurement fails.
