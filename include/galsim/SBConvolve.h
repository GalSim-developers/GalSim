    /**
     * @brief Convolve SBProfiles.
     *
     * Convolve two, three or more SBProfiles together.
     *
     * The profiles to be convolved may be provided either as the first 2 or 3 parameters in the
     * constructor, or as a std::list<SBProfile>.
     *
     * The convolution will normally be done using discrete Fourier transforms of each of the
     * component profiles, multiplying them together, and then transforming back to real space.  The
     * nominal flux of the resulting SBConvolve is the product of the fluxes of each of the
     * component profiles.  Thus, when using the SBConvolve to convolve a galaxy of some desired
     * flux with a PSF, it is important to normalize the flux in the PSF to 1 beforehand.
     *
     * The stepK used for the k-space image will be (Sum 1/stepK()^2)^(-1/2) where the sum is over
     * all the components being convolved.  Since the size of the convolved image scales roughly as
     * the quadrature sum of the components, this should be close to Pi/Rmax where Rmax is the
     * radius that encloses all but (1-alias_threshold) of the flux in the final convolved image.
     *
     * The maxK used for the k-space image will be the minimum of the maxK() calculated for each
     * component.  Since the k-space images are multiplied, if one of them is essentially zero
     * beyond some k value, then that will be true of the final image as well.
     *
     * There is also an option to do the convolution as integrals in real space.  Each constructor
     * has an optional boolean parameter, real_space, that comes immediately after the list of
     * profiles to convolve.  Currently, the real-space integration is only enabled for 2 profiles.
     * If you try to use it for more than 2 profiles, an exception will be thrown.
     *
     * The real-space convolution is normally slower than the DFT convolution.  The exception is if
     * both component profiles have hard edges (e.g. a truncated Moffat with a Box).  In that case,
     * the maxK for each component is quite large since the ringing dies off fairly slowly.  So it
     * can be quicker to use real-space convolution instead.
