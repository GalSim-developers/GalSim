     * @brief Class used to represent a linear interval or an annulus of probability function
     *
     * An `Interval` is a contiguous domain over which a `FluxDensity` function is well-behaved,
     * having no sign changes or extrema, which will make it easier to sample the FluxDensity
     * function over its domain using either rejection sampling or by weighting uniformly 
     * distributed photons.
     *
     * This class could be made a subclass of `OneDimensionalDeviate` as it should only be used by
     * methods of that class.
     *
     * The `Interval` represents flux (or unnormalized probability) density in a continguous
     * interval on on the line, or, for `_isRadial=true`, represents axisymmetric density in an
     * annulus on the plane.
     *
     * The object keeps track of the integrated flux (or unnormalized probability) in its
     * interval/annulus, and the cumulative flux of all intervals up to and including this one.
     *
     * The `drawWithin()` method will select one photon (and flux) drawn from within this interval
     * or annulus, such that the expected flux distribution matches the FluxDensity function.  This
     * can be done one of two ways: If `_useRejectionMethod=true`, then an x (or r) position is
     * chosen that would match the chosen cumulative flux were the FluxDensity uniform over the
     * interval.  Then the FluxDensity is evaluated, compared to the maximum within the interval
     * (which is always an endpoint), and a UniformDeviate is drawn to decide whether to keep or
     * reject this x photon.  This repeats until a position is kept.
     *
     * If `_useRejectionMethod=false`, then no rejection is done.  The photon is kept, but is given
     * a flux value equal to the FluxDensity at x relative to the mean over the interval.  This is
     * faster but makes the statistics of the photons harder to interpret.
     *
     * See the `OneDimensionalDeviate` docstrings for more information.

     * @brief Class which implements random sampling of an arbitrary one-dimensional distribution,
     * for photon shooting.
     *
     * The point of this class is to take any function that is derived from `FluxDensity` and be
     * able to sample it with photons such that the expectation value of the flux density matches
     * the input function exactly.  This class is for functions which do not have convenient
     * analytic means of inverting their cumulative flux distribution.
     *
     * As explained in SBProfile::shoot(), both positive and negative-flux photons can exist, but we
     * aim that the absolute value of flux be nearly constant so that statistical errors are
     * predictable.  This code does this by first dividing the domain of the function into
     * `Interval` objects, with known integrated (absolute) flux in each.  To shoot a photon, a
     * UniformDeviate is selected and scaled to represent the cumulative flux that should exist
     * within the position of the photon.  The class first uses the binary-search feature built into
     * the Standard Library `set` container to locate the `Interval` that will contain the photon.
     * Then it asks the `Interval` to decide where within the `Interval` to place the photon.  As
     * noted in the `Interval` docstring, this can be done either by rejection sampling, or - if the
     * range of FluxDensity values within an interval is small - by simply adjusting the flux to
     * account for deviations from uniform flux density within the interval.
     *
     * On construction, the class must be provided with some information about the nature of the
     * function being sampled.  The length scale and flux scale of the function should be of order
     * unity.  The elements of the `range` array should be ordered, span the desired domain of the
     * function, and split the domain into intervals such that:
     * - There are no sign changes within an interval
     * - There is at most one extremum within the interval
     * - Any extremum can be localized by sampling the interval at `RANGE_DIVISION_FOR_EXTREMA`
         equidistant points.
     * - The function is smooth enough to be integrated over the interval with standard basic 
     *   methods.
