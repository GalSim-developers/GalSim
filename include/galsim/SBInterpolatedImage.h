     * @brief Surface Brightness Profile represented by interpolation over one or more data 
     * tables/images.
     *
     * The SBInterpolatedImage class represents an arbitrary surface brightness profile (supplied as
     * an image), including rules for how to interpolate the profile between the supplied pixel
     * values.
     *
     * It is assumed that input images oversample the profiles they represent.  maxK() is set at 
     * the Nyquist frequency of the input image, although it should be noted that interpolants 
     * other than the ideal sinc function may make the max frequency higher than this.  The output
     * is required to be periodic on a scale > original image extent + kernel footprint, and 
     * stepK() is set accordingly. 
     *
     * The normal way to make an SBInterpolatedImage is to provide the image to interpolate
     * and the interpolation scheme.  See Interpolant.h for more about the different 
     * kind of interpolation.  
     *
     * You can provide different interpolation schemes for real and fourier space
     * (passed as xInterp and kInterp respectively).  If either one is omitted, the 
     * defaults are:
     *
     * xInterp = Lanczos(5, fluxConserve=true, tol=kvalue_accuracy)
     *
     * kInterp = Quintic(tol=kvalue_accuracy)
     *
     * The ideal k-space interpolant is a sinc function; however, the quintic interpolant is the
     * default, based on detailed investigations on the tradeoffs between accuracy and speed.  Note
     * that, as in Bernstein & Gruen (2012), the accuracy achieved by this interpolant is dependent
     * on our choice of 4x pad factor.  Users who do not wish to pad the arrays to this degree may
     * need to use a higher-order Lanczos interpolant instead, but this is not the recommended
     * usage.
     *
     * There are also optional arguments for the pixel size (default is to get it from
     * the image), and a factor by which to pad the image (default = 4).
     *
     * You can also make an SBInterpolatedImage as a weighted sum of several images
     * using MultipleImageHelper.  This helper object holds the images and their fourier
     * transforms, so it is efficient to make many SBInterpolatedImages with different
     * weight vectors.  This version does not take the `dx` or `pad_factor` parameters,
     * since these are set in the MultipleImageHelper constructor.
