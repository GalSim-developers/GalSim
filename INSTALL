1. Software required before building galsim
===========================================

i) Python (2.6 or 2.7 series), with some additional modules installed
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The interface to the GalSim code is via the Python package "galsim", and its 
associated modules.  Therefore you must have Python installed on your system.  
Python is free, and available from a number of sources online (see below).  
Currently GalSim only supports Python versions 2.6.X and 2.7.X, but earlier 
versions of Python 2.X may be supported in future: please let us know via 
Github if you need this support.  

Many systems have a version of Python pre-installed.  To check whether you 
already have a compatible version, type

python --version

at the terminal prompt.  If you get a "Command not found" error, or the 
reported version is not 2.6.X or 2.7.X, you will need to install 2.6 or 2.7 
series Python.  In this case you should read the "Getting Python and required 
modules" Section below.  

It may be that there is or soon will be more than one version of Python 
installed on your operating system, in which case please see the "Making sure 
you are using the right Python" Section below.  

Getting Python and required modules
-----------------------------------
For a list of places to download Python, see http://www.python.org/getit/.  

The galsim package also requires 

* the numerical Python module NumPy (http://numpy.scipy.org)

* the astronomical FITS file input/output module PyFITS 
  (http://www.stsci.edu/institute/software_hardware/pyfits)

* the Python YAML parser and emitter module PyYAML 
  (http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML) 
  Note: PyYAML is in fact only required for full config file parsing 
  functionality, and can be ommitted if users are happy to use JSON-style 
  config parsing 

These should installed onto your Python system so that they can be imported by:

>>> import numpy
>>> import pyfits
>>> import yaml   [ if using PyYAML ]

within Python.  You can test this by loading up the Python interpreter for the 
version of Python you'll be using with the GalSim toolkit.  This is usually 
achieved by typing "python" or "/path/to/executable/bin/python" if your 
desired Python is not the system default, and typing the import commands above,
If you get no warning message, things are OK.  

If you do not have these modules, follow the links above or alternatively try 
"easy_install" (or equivalently "/path/to/executable/bin/easy_install" if your 
desired Python is not the default).  

As an example, if using the default system Python, connected to the internet 
and with root/admin privileges simply type

easy_install numpy
easy_install pyfits
easy_install pyyaml

at prompt.  If not using an admin account, prefix the commands above with
"sudo " and enter your admin password when prompted.  The required modules
should then be installed.  

See http://packages.python.org/distribute/easy_install.html#using-easy-install 
for more details about the extremely useful easy_install feature.

Third party-maintained Python packages
--------------------------------------
There are a number of third party-maintained packages which bundle Python with 
many of the numerical and scientific libraries that are commonly used, and 
many of these are free for non-commericial or academic use.  

One good example of such a package, which includes all of the Python 
dependencies required by GalSim (NumPy, PyFITS, PyYAML as well as SCons and 
nosetests; see Section 2 below) is the Enthought Python Distribution (EPD; see 
http://enthought.com/products/edudownload.php for the academic download 
instructions).  Other re-packaged Python downloads can be found at 
http://www.python.org/getit/.  

Making sure you are using the right Python
------------------------------------------
Some users will find they have a few versions of Python around their operating 
system (determined, for example, using "locate python" at prompt).  A common 
way this will happen if there is already an older build (e.g. Python 2.4.X) 
being used by the operating system and then you install a newer version from 
one of the sources described above.  

It will be important to make sure that the version of Python for which Numpy, 
PyFITS and PyYAML etc. are installed is also the one being used for GalSim, 
and that this is the one *you* want to use GalSim from!  Knowing which 
installed version of Python will be used is also important for the installation
of the Boost libraries (see Section 1.v, below).  

To check which Python is your default you can identify the location of the 
executable by, for example, typing

which python

at prompt.  This will tell you the location of the executable, something like
/path/to/executable/bin/python

If this is not the Python you want, please edit your startup scripts (e.g.
.profile or .bashrc), and be sure to specify where your desired Python version 
resides when installing the Boost C++ libraries (see Section 1.v).

A final check: Shared libraries
-------------------------------
Before building and installing the software below, please do make sure that 
Python is built with shared libraries.  On some systems, the default is *not* 
to build Python with shared libraries, which will result in mysterious issues 
when trying to compile GalSim (apparent numpy-related failures).  In the few 
cases where this issue was identified, Python had been compiled from source 
directly; developers who used Python from pre-packaged third party distributions
did not tend to encounter this problem.  

To check, you can look for the libraries in

/path/to/executable/lib/libpython*.dylib [if you're on a Mac]

or

/path/to/executable/lib/libpython*.so [on Linux]

If the libraries are not there, you may need to rebuild Python with shared 
libraries using --enable-shared.  Note that if you discover this after 
installing all the dependencies below, then you'll have to rebuild the Python-
related dependencies after rebuilding Python -- so it's better to check 
beforehand.  

See Section 4 of this document for some suggestions about getting Python, Boost
and all the other dependencies all working well together on your specific 
system.


ii) SCons (http://www.scons.org)
--------------------------------

GalSim uses SCons to configure and run its installation procedures, and so SCons
needs to be installed in advance.  Versions 2.0 and 2.1 of SCons get reasonable
testing with GalSim, but it should also work with 1.x versions.  You can check 
if it is installed, and if so which version, by typing

scons --version

SCons itself is written in Python, and running "scons" invokes a Python 
interpreter.  GalSim will be configured to build against the same Python that 
is being used to run SCons.  Making sure that matches the Python you'd like to 
use can help you avoid a lot of problems later on.  Many of the pre-packaged 
Python distributions (e.g. EPD) also come with SCons, so this can be a good way
to ensure that SCons and GalSim use the same underlying Python distribution.  

See Section 4 for some more suggestions about installing this on your platform.


iii) FFTW (http://www.fftw.org)
-------------------------------

These Fast Fourier Transform libraries must be installed as GalSim will link 
to them during the build; see Section 4 for some suggestions about installing 
this on your platform.  


iv) TMV (http://code.google.com/p/tmv-cpp/)  (version >= 0.71 required)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

GalSim uses the TMV library for its linear algebra routines.  You should 
download it from the site above and follow the instructions in its INSTALL 
file for how to install it.   Usually installing TMV just requires the command

scons install PREFIX=<installdir>

but there are additional options you might consider, so you should read the TMV
INSTALL file for full details.   Also note, you may not need to specify the 
installation directory if you are comfortable installing it into /usr/local.
However, if you are trying to install it into a system directory then you need 
to use sudo scons install [PREFIX=<installdir>].  

v) Boost C++ (http://www.boost.org)
-----------------------------------

GalSim makes use of some of the Boost C++ libraries, and these parts of Boost 
must be installed.  It is particularly important that your installed Boost 
library links to the same version of Python which which you will be using 
galsim and on which you have installed NumPy and PyFITS (see Section ii, above). 
Boost can be downloaded from the above website, and must be installed per the 
(rather limited) instructions there, which essentially amount to using a command
./bootstrap.sh

(Additional bootstrap.sh options may be necessary to ensure Boost is built 
against the correct version of Python; see below).

followed by

./b2 link=shared
./b2 --prefix=<INSTALL_DIR> link=shared install
(if you are installing to a system directory, the second needs to be run as 
 root, of course ./b2...)

The link=shared is necessary to ensure that they are built as shared libraries; 
this is automatic on some platforms, but not all.

Note: if you don't want to install everything related to boost (which takes a 
while), you can restrict to boost Python and math by using --with-python 
--with-math on the ./b2 commands.  Currently we are only using Boost Python, 
but there may be parts of the math library we want to use so installing these 
two will likely be sufficient for the forseeable future.  

Once you have installed Boost, you can check that it links to the version of 
Python that will be used for GalSim and on which you have installed Numpy and 
Pyfits by typing 

ldd <YOUR_BOOST_LIB_DIR>/libboost_python<POSSIBLE_SUFFIX>.so  (on Linux)
otool -L <YOUR_BOOST_LIB_DIR>/libboost_python<POSSIBLE_SUFFIX>.dylib  (on OSX)

(If the ldd command on Linux does not show the Python version, the command
"ls -l <YOUR_BOOST_LIB_LOCATION>/libboost_python*" may show the version of 
libboost_python.so linked to, for example, libboost_python_py26.so.1.40.0.  In 
such a case you can tell both the Python and Boost versions being used, 2.6 
and 1.40.0, respectively, in this example.) 

If the Python library listed is the one you will be using, all is well.  If not,
Boost can be forced to use a different version by specifying the following 
options to the ./bootstrap.sh installation script (defaults in [] brackets):

  --with-python=PYTHON      specify the Python executable [python]
  --with-python-root=DIR    specify the root of the Python installation
                            [automatically detected, but some users have found 
                            they have to force it to use a specific one because 
                            it detected the wrong one]


2. Installing the galsim Python package
=======================================

Once you have installed all the dependencies described above, you are ready to 
build GalSim.  From the GalSim base directory (in which this INSTALL file is 
found) type 

scons

If everything above was installed in fairly standard locations, this may work 
the first time.  Otherwise, you may have to tell SCons where to find some of 
those libraries.  There are quite a few options that you can use to tell SCons 
where to look, as well as other things about the build process.  To see a list 
of options you can pass to SCons, type 

scons -h

(See also Section 5 below.) 

As an example, to specify where your TMV library is located, you can type

scons TMV_DIR=<tmv-dir>

where <tmv-dir> would be the same as the PREFIX you specified when installing 
TMV, i.e. The TMV library and include files are installed in <tmv-dir>/lib and 
<tmv-dir>/include.  Some important options that you may need to set are:

  TMV_DIR: Explicitly give the tmv prefix

  FFTW_DIR: Explicitly give the fftw3 prefix

  BOOST_DIR: Explicitly give the boost prefix

  EXTRA_LIBS: Additional libraries to send to the linker

  EXTRA_INCLUDE_PATH: Extra paths for header files (separated by : if more 
                      than 1) 

  EXTRA_FLAGS: Extra flags to send to the compiler other than what is 
               automatically used.  (e.g. -m64 to force 64 bit compilation)
    
Again, you can see the full list of options using scons -h.

Another common option is CXX=<c++compiler>.  So, to compile with icpc rather 
than the default g++, type

scons CXX=icpc

One nice feature of SCons is that once you have specified a parameter, it will 
save that value for future builds in the file gs_scons.conf, so once you have 
the build process working, for later builds you only need to type scons.  It 
can also be useful to edit this file directly -- mostly if you want to unset a 
parameter and return to the default value, it can be easier to just delete the 
line from this file, rather than explicitly set it back to the default value.  

SCons caches the results of the various checks it does for the required 
external libraries (tmv, boost, etc.).  This is usually very helpful, since 
they don't generally change, so it makes later builds much faster.  However, 
sometimes (rarely) SCons can get confused and not realized that things on your 
system have changed, which might cause problems for you.  You can delete 
everything scons knows about what it has tried to build previously with 

/bin/rm -rf .scon*

This will force SCons to recheck and recompile everything from scratch.

Once you have a successful build, you can install the GalSim library, Python 
modules, and header files into standard locations (like /usr/local and your 
Python site-packages directory) with 

scons install

or 

sudo scons install

If you want to install into a different location, the prefix for the library 
and header files can be specified with PREFIX=<installdir>, and the location 
for the Python modules can be specified with PYPREFIX=<pythondir>.  So the 
command would be 

scons install PREFIX=<installdir> PYPREFIX=<pythondir>

The installed files are removed with the command

scons uninstall

Finally, to clean all compiled objects from the GalSim directory, you can use

scons -c

This is rather like a "make clean" command.

If you are having trouble with installing, you may find some helpful hints at 
the GalSim Installation FAQ page on the Wiki: 
https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim/wiki/Installation%20FAQs

If you are still having trouble, please consider opening a new Issue on the 
GalSim Github page at https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim to help find 
a solution for the problem.  


3. Running tests and installing example executables
===================================================

You can run our test suite by typing

scons tests

This should compile the test suite and run it.  The tests of our C++ library 
will always be run, but we use nosetests for our Python test suite, so that will
only be run if nosetests is present on your system.  We don't require this as a
dependency, since you can still do everything with the GalSim library without 
this.  But it is required for a complete run of the test suite.  

To install nosetests, you can also use easy_install as described in Section 1 
above (see also http://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).  Many third party-
maintained Python distributions, such as the Enthought Python Distribution, 
include nosetests.  

Note: if your system doesn't have nosetests installed, and you don't want to 
install it, you can run all the python tests with the script run_all_tests in 
the tests directory.  If this finishes without an error, then all the tests 
have passed.  

There are also some example executables that come with GalSim, and will be 
useful for testing and development particularly outside the Python layer.  These
can be built by typing 

scons examples

The executables will then be visible in GalSim/bin/.

The examples directory also has a series of demo scripts: 
demo1.py, demo2.py, ... 

These can be considered a tutorial on getting up to speed with GalSim.  Reading
through these in order will introduce you to how to use most of the features of
GalSim in python.  

There are also a corresponding set of config files: 
demo1.yaml, demo2.yaml, ... 

These files can be run using the executable galsim_yaml, and will produce the 
same output images as the python scripts.  They are also well commented, and 
can be considered a parallel tutorial for learning the config file usage of 
GalSim.  


4. Platform-specific notes 
==========================

i) Linux
--------
The vast majority of Linux distributions provide installable packages for most 
of our dependencies.  In may cases, however, it is also necessary to install 
"-devel" or "-dev" packages (e.g. python-dev or libboost-dev on Debian-
derivatives).  However, as above we stress that you should make sure that the 
version of Python that Boost is built against must be the same as that you 
intend to use for running GalSim.  

The solution may be to install Boost C++ manually. This can be done by following
the instructions of Section 1.v), above.

ii) Mac OSX
-----------
a) Use of Fink -- the fink (http://www.finkproject.org) package management 
software is popular with Mac users.  Once it is installed, all of the library 
dependencies of GalSim can be added with the following commands:

fink install scons
fink install fftw3
fink install tmv0
fink install boost1.46.1.cmake
(Python 2.6 should already be in /usr/bin/python but fink can also be asked to 
install a version into its /sw/bin directory.)

However, there is a slight caveat regarding the use of fink-installed Boost C++
and the Enthought Python Distribution or other third party-maintained Python 
distributions.  These are not necessarily automatically detected as the 
installed version of Python when fink installs the Boost C++ library.  

The solution is to install Boost C++ manually. This can be done by following the
instructions of Section 1.v), above.

You may still need to install NumPy and PyFITS manually, e.g. using 
easy_install, with your chosen Python.  This is because the fink of these 
Python modules install and use a fink Python build in /sw/bin/python2.7 (or 
similar), which may not be your desired version.  Of course, if you have setup 
your default Python to be the fink/Macports installed version, using these 
package managers to install NumPy and PyFITS will be fine.  

b) Macports -- this is another popular Mac package management project 
(http://www.macports.org/) with similar functionality to fink, although TMV
is not supported but can be easily installed by following the instructions 
in Section 1.iv).  

Note that when using MacPorts to install boost, you may need to explicitly 
indicate Boost.Python, for example

sudo port install boost +python27

You may still need to install NumPy and PyFITS manually, e.g. using 
easy_install, with your chosen Python.  This is because when fink installs these
Python modules, it use a fink Python built in /sw/bin/python2.7 (or similar), 
which may not be your desired version.  Of course, if you have setup your
default Python to be the fink or Macports installed version, using these package
managers to install NumPy and PyFITS will be fine.  

5. More SCons options
=====================

Here is a fairly complete list of the options you can pass to SCons to control 
the build process.  The options are listed with their default value.  You change
them simply by specifying a different value on the command line.  

For example:

  scons CXX=icpc TMV_DIR=~

(Unlike autotools, SCons correctly expands ~ to your home directory.)
You can list these options from the command line with 

  scons -h

Basic flags about the C++ compilation (listed with their default values in 
parentheses):

  CXX (g++) specifies which C++ compiler to use.
  FLAGS ('') specifies the basic flags to pass to the compiler.  
           The default behavior is to automatically choose good flags to use 
           according to which kind of compiler you are using.  This option 
           overrides that and lets you specify exactly what flags to use. 
  EXTRA_FLAGS ('') specifies some extra flags that you want to use in addition 
           to the defaults that SCons determines on its own.  Unlike the above 
           option, this doesn't override the defaults, it just adds to them.
  DEBUG (True) specifies whether to keep the debugging assert statements in 
           the compiled library code.  They aren't much of a performance hit,
           so it is generally worth keeping them in, but if you need to squeeze
           out every last bit of performance, you can set this to False.
  WARN (False) specifies whether to add warning compiler flags such as -Wall.
           Developers should set this to True and fix everything that comes up 
           as a warning (on both g++ and icpc).  However, end users can leave 
           it as False in case their compiler is a stickler for something that 
           didn't get caught in development.
           #TODO: Move this prescription that developers should set it to True 
           somewhere else.  Maybe in the credo.txt file?
  PYTHON (/usr/bin/env python) specified which version of python you are 
           planning to use GalSim with.  If you choose not to use the default 
           here, then you need to remember to use the correct python version 

Flags about where to install the library and modules:

  PREFIX (/usr/local) specifies where to install the library when running scons 
           install.
  PYPREFIX ([your python dir]/site-packages) specifies where to install the 
           Python modules when running scons install.

Flags that specify where to look for external libraries:

  TMV_DIR ('') specifies the location of TMV if it is not in a standard 
           location.  This should be the same value as you used for PREFIX when
           installing TMV.
  TMV_LINK ('') specifies the location of the tmv-link file.  Normally, this is
           in TMV_DIR/share, but if not, you can specify the correct location 
           here.
  FFTW_DIR ('') specifies the root location of FFTW.  The header files should
           be in FFTW_DIR/include and the library files in FFTW_DIR/lib.
  BOOST_DIR ('') specifies the root location of BOOST  The header files should 
           be in BOOST_DIR/include/boost and the library files in BOOST_DIR/lib.
  EXTRA_INCLUDE_PATH ('') specifies extra directories in which to search for 
           header files in addition to the standard locations such as 
           /usr/include and /usr/local/include and the ones derived from the 
           above options.  Sometimes the above options don't quite work, so
           you may need to specify other locations, which is what this option 
           is for.  These directories are specified as -I flags to the 
           compiler.  If you are giving multiple directories, they should be 
           separated by colons.
  EXTRA_LIB_PATH ('') specifies extra directories in which to search for 
           libraries in addition to the standard locations such as 
           /usr/lib and /usr/local/lib.  These directories are specified as -L 
           flags to the linker.  If you are giving multiple directories, they
           should be separated by colons.
  EXTRA_PATH ('') specifies directories in which to search for executables 
           (notably the compiler, although you can also just give the full
           path in the CXX parameter) in addition to the standard locations
           such as /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin.  If you are giving multiple 
           directories, they should be separated by colons.
  IMPORT_PATHS (False) specifies whether to import extra path directories 
           from the environment variables: PATH, C_INCLUDE_PATH, 
           LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH.  If you have a complicated setup 
           in which you use these environment variables to control everything,
           this can be an easy way to let SCons know about these locations.
  IMPORT_ENV (True) specifies whether to import the entire environment from 
           the calling shell.  The default is for SCons to use the same 
           environment as the shell from which it is called.  However, 
           sometimes it can be useful to start with a clean environment and 
           manually add paths for various things, in which case you would 
           want to set this to False.
  EXTRA_LIBS ('') specifies libraries to use in addition to what SCons finds 
           on its own.  This might be useful if you have a non-standard name 
           for one of the external libraries.  e.g. If you want to use the 
           Intel MKL library for the fftw3 library, SCons won't automatically 
           try that, so you could add those libraries here.  If there is more 
           than one, they should be quoted with spaces between the different 
           libraries.  e.g.  EXTRA_LIBS="mkl_intel mkl_intel_thread mkl_core"
  INCLUDE_PREFIX_PATHS ('True') specifies whether to include the directories
           PREFIX/include, PREFIX/lib and PREFIX/bin as part of the standard
           path lists.  Normally, you install everything in the same place,
           so it is useful to search those locations for some of the 
           prerequisite packages, so the default is True.  But occasionally,
           this might be inconvenient, so you can turn this feature off.

Miscellaneous flags:

  NOSETESTS (nosetests) specifies which version of nosetests you want to use
           for running the unit tests.  If you specified a non-default python,
           then there is a possibility that the standard nosetests executable
           in your path won't work (since it might be for a different version
           of python).  In that case, specify the correct nosetests here.
  CACHE_LIB (True) specifies whether to cache the results of the library checks
           While you are working one getting the prerequisites installed 
           properly, it can be useful to set this to False to force SCons to 
           redo all of its library checks each time.  Once you have a 
           successful build, you should set it back to True so that later 
           builds can skip those checks.
  WITH_PROF (False) specifies whether to use the compiler flag -pg to include 
           profiling info for gprof.
  MEM_TEST (False) specifies whether to test the code for memory leaks.
  TMV_DEBUG (False) specifies whether to turn on extra (slower) debugging 
           statements within the TMV library.
  WITH_OPENMP (False) specifies whether to use OpenMP to parallelize some parts
           of the code.  (We don't actually use OpenMP currently, so this 
           doesn't do anything.)
  USE_UNKNOWN_VARS (False) specifies whether to accept scons parameters other
           than the ones listed here.  Normally, another name would indicate
           a typo, so we catch it and let you know.  But if you want to use
           other scons options that we didn't list here, you would want to 
           also set this to True.
