--- GalSim Installation Instructions ---

Here are some notes on the installation of the GalSim toolkit, which uses SCons as its primary build
system.  Currently, these notes are aimed at GalSim developers: they may need to be tightened up for
public consumption!

For info regarding SCons usage (once installed, see below) you can type

scons --help

or see http://www.scons.org/documentation.php

1. Libraries/software required before building

i) SCons (http://www.scons.org)

This build system manager needs to be installed, as it is used by the GalSim installation process.
Versions 2.0 and 2.1 get reasonable testing, but it should also work with 1.x  versions.  Check 
if it is installed, and if so which version, by typing

scons --version

See Section 4 of this document (platform-specific notes) for some easy-to-install sources of the 
SCons software.

SCons itself is written in Python, and running "scons" invokes a Python interpreter.  GalSim will 
be configured to build against the same Python that is being used to run SCons.  Making sure that 
matches the Python you'd like to use can help you avoid a lot of problems later on.


ii) Python (with Numpy and PyFITS modules installed)
The heart of this code is the Python package galsim and its associated modules.  So you need Python
(#TODO: Make a decision about versions).  

The galsim package will also assume that the Numpy (http://numpy.scipy.org) module and the 
astronomical FITS file format input/output module Pyfits 
(http://www.stsci.edu/institute/software_hardware/pyfits) are installed onto your Python system so 
that they can both be imported by

import numpy
import pyfits

You can test this by loading up the Python interpreter for the version of python you'll be using 
with the GalSim toolkit, and typing the two import commands above.  If you get no warning message, 
things are OK.

Some users will find they have a few versions of Python around their operating system.  It will be 
important to make sure that the version of Python for which Numpy and Pyfits are installed is also 
the one being used for GalSim, and that this is the one *you* want to use GalSim from!

Knowing which installed version of Python will be used is also important for the installation of 
the Boost libraries (see 1.v, below).  See Section 4 of this document for some suggestions about 
getting Python, numpy, pyfits and Boost all working well together on your specfic system.


iii) FFTW (http://www.fftw.org)

These Fast Fourier Transform libraries must be installed; see Section 4 for some suggestions about 
installing this on your platform.


iv) TMV (http://code.google.com/p/tmv-cpp/)

GalSim uses the TMV library for its linear algebra routines.  You should download it from the 
above site and follow the instructions in its INSTALL file for how to install it.   Usually it 
just requires the command

scons install PREFIX=<installdir>

but there are additional options you might consider, so you should read its INSTALL file for full 
details (also note, you may not need to specify the installation directory if you are comfortable 
with the default that is noted in the scons INSTALL file).  Note: if you are trying to install into
a system directory then you need to use sudo, i.e.  sudo scons install PREFIX=<installdir>


v) Boost C++ (http://www.boost.org)

GalSim makes use of some of the Boost C++ libraries, and Boost must be installed.  It is 
particularly important that your installed Boost library links to the version of Python you will 
be running the galsim package from, and on which you have installed Numpy and Pyfits (see ii, 
above).  Boost can be downloaded from the above website, and must be installed per the (rather 
limited) instructions there, which essentially amount to using a command 

./bootstrap.sh

(Additional to bootstrap.sh options may be necessary to ensure Boost is built against the correct 
version of Python; see below).

followed by

./b2 link=shared
./b2 --prefix=<INSTALL_DIR> link=shared install
(if you are installing to a system directory, the second needs to be run as
 root, of course ./b2...)

The link=shared is necessary to ensure that they are built as shared libraries; this is automatic 
on some platforms, but not all.

Note: if you don't want to install everything related to boost (which takes a while), you can 
restrict to boost python and math by using --with-python --with-math on the ./b2 commands.  
Currently we are only using boost python, but there are plans to use the RNG in boost math, so 
installing these two seems like the best bet for now.

Once you have installed Boost, you can check that it links to the version of python that will be 
used for GalSim and on which you have installed Numpy and Pyfits by typing

ldd <YOUR_BOOST_LIB_LOCATION>/libboost_python<POSSIBLE_SUFFFIX>.so  (on Linux)
otool -L <YOUR_BOOST_LIB_LOCATION>/libboost_python<POSSIBLE_SUFFFIX>.dylib  (on OSX)

If the Python library listed is the one you will be using, all is well.  If not, Boost can be forced
to use a different version by specifying the following options to the ./bootstrap.sh installation 
script (defaults in [] brackets):

  --with-python=PYTHON      specify the Python executable [python]
  --with-python-root=DIR    specify the root of the Python installation
                            [automatically detected, but some users have found they have to
                            force it to use a specific one because it detected the wrong one] 

#TODO: Add Windows checks??


vi) CFITSIO

Install CFITSIO.

#TODO: Remove this once we handle all FITS i/o in python.  But for now, we do need it. 


2. Installing the galsim Python package

From the GalSim base directory (in which this INSTALL file is found) type

scons

If everything above was installed, you *might* be lucky enough to have this work first time.
Otherwise, you may have to tell SCons where to find some of those libraries.  There are quite a few 
options that you can use to tell SCons where to look, as well as other things about the build 
process.  To see a list of options you can pass to SCons, type

scons -h

(See also section 5 below.) 
For example, to specify where your TMV library is located, you can type

scons TMV_DIR=<mylibdir>

where <mylibdir> would be the same as the PREFIX you specified when installing TMV. i.e. The TMV 
library and include files are installed in <mylibdir>/lib and <mylibdir>/include.

Another common option is CXX=<c++compiler>.  So to compile with icpc rather than the default g++, 
type

scons CXX=icpc

One nice feature of SCons is that once you have specified a parameter, it will save that value for 
future builds in the file gs_scons.conf, so once you have the build process working, for later 
builds you only need to type scons.  It can also be useful to edit this file directly -- mostly if 
you want to unset a parameter and return to the default value, it can be easier to just delete the 
line from this file, rather than explicitly set it back to the default value.

Also, SCons caches the results of the various checks it does for the required external libraries 
(tmv, boost, etc.).  This is usually very helpful, since they don't generally change, so it makes 
later builds much faster.  However, sometimes you don't want SCons to remember the results while 
you are initally setting things up.  For example, you might recompile the boost library with a 
different compiler or python version.  In this case, you can tell SCons not to cache the results 
of previous library tests with 

scons CACHE_LIB=false

Once everything is working, you can set it back to true.  Sometimes (rarely) this won't be 
sufficient, and you might need to completely blow away everything scons knows about what it has 
tried to build previously.  You can do this with 

/bin/rm -rf .scon*

This will force SCons to recheck and recompile everything from scratch.

#TODO: Add more here... perhaps link to Wiki FAQs?
#TODO: Windows?

Once you have a successful build, you can install the GalSim library, python modules, and header 
files into standard locations (like /usr/local and your Python site-packages directory) with

scons install
or 
sudo scons install

If you want to install into a different location, the prefix for the library and header files can 
be specified with PREFIX=<installdir>, and the location for the python modules can be specified 
with PYPREFIX=<pythondir>.  So the command would be

scons install PREFIX=<installdir> PYPREFIX=<pythondir>

The installed files are removed with the command

scons uninstall

Finally, to clean all compiled objects from the GalSim directory, you can use

scons -c

This is rather like a "make clean" command.



3. Installing example and test executables

There are some example executables that come with GalSim, and will be useful for testing and
development particularly outside the python layer.  

These can be built by typing

scons examples

The executables will then be visible in GalSim/bin/.  If you wish to install them to some other 
directory (e.g. one visible to $PATH) then this can be done by

scons install examples PREFIX=<installdir>

where <installdir> is the directory you wish to install to (default if unset is /usr/local).  These 
changes can be reversed using

scons uninstall examples

We don't have any test programs yet, but once we do, they will be built and run by typing

scons tests

This should compile the test suite and run it. 


4. Platform-specific notes 

i) Linux

The vast majority of Linux distributions provide installable packages for most of our dependencies. 
In may cases, however, it is also necessary to install "-devel" or "-dev" packages (e.g. python-dev
or libboost-dev on Debian-derivatives).


ii) Mac OSX  (#TODO: Expand this, maybe move it to a Wiki FAQ)

a) Use of Fink -- the fink (http://www.finkproject.org) package management software is popular with
Mac users.  Once it is installed, all of the library dependencies of GalSim can be added 
with the following commands:

fink install scons
fink install fftw3
fink install tmv0
fink install boost1.46.1.cmake
fink install cfitsio
(Python 2.6 should already be in /usr/bin/python.)

However, there is a slight caveat regarding the use of fink-installed Boost C++ and the 
Enthought Python Distribution, see below...

Macports is another popular Mac package management project with similar functionality 
(although TMV isn't on that one).  Note that when using MacPorts to install boost, you may need to explicitly indicate Boost.Python, e.g., using

sudo port install boost +python27


b) The Enthought Python Distribution (EPD) is a single-install package that provides Python, Numpy,
and SCons, along with many other useful Python modules in a well-maintined single framework.  It 
is free for academic use (http://enthought.com/products/edudownload.php).

However, it is not automatically detected as the installed version of Python when fink installs the
Boost C++ library.  For GalSim to work, it needs to be.

The solution is then to install Boost C++ manually, which luckily is relatively straightforward. 
This can be done by following the instructions of Section 1.v), above.

(#TODO: This maybe is not even truly a Mac-only issue, as EPD is also available for Linux and
Windows...)


5. More SCons options

Here is a fairly complete list of the options you can pass to SCons to control the build process.  
The options are listed with their default value.  You change them simply by specifying a different 
value on the command line.  
For example:

  scons CXX=icpc TMV_DIR=~

(Unlike autotools, SCons correctly expands ~ to your home directory.)
You can list these options from the command line with 

  scons -h

Basic flags about the C++ compilation:

  CXX=g++ specifies which C++ compiler to use.
  FLAGS='' specifies the basic flags to pass to the compiler.  
           The default behavior is to automatically choose good flags to use according 
	   to which kind of compiler you are using.  This option overrides that and 
	   lets you specify exactly what flags to use. 
  EXTRA_FLAGS='' specifies some extra flags that you want to use in addition to 
           the defaults that SCons determines on its own.  Unlike the above option,
	   this doesn't override the defaults, it just adds to them.
  DEBUG=true specifies whether to keep the debugging assert statements in the compiled 
           library code.  They aren't much of a performance hit, so it is generally worth
	   keeping them in, but if you need to squeeze out every last bit of performance,
	   you can set this to false.
  WARN=false specifies whether to add warning compiler flags such as -Wall.
           Developers should set this to true and fix everything that comes up as a warning
	   (on both g++ and icpc).  However, end users can leave it as false in case their
	   compiler is a stickler for something that didn't get caught in development.
	   #TODO: Move this prescription that developers should set it to true somewhere
	   else.  Maybe in the credo.txt file?
  WITH_OPENMP=true specifies whether to use OpenMP to parallelize some parts of the code.

Flags about where to install the library and modules:

  PREFIX=/usr/local specifies where to install the library when running scons install.
  PYPREFIX=[your python dir]/site-packages specifies where to install the Python 
           modules when running scons install.

Flags that specify where to look for external libraries:

  TMV_DIR='' specifies the location of TMV if it is not in a standard location.
           This should be the same value as you used for PREFIX when installing TMV.
  TMV_LINK='' specifies the location of the tmv-link file.  Normally, this is in
           TMV_DIR/share, but if not, you can specify the correct location here.
  FFTW_DIR='' specifies the root location of FFTW.  The header files should be in
           FFTW_DIR/include and the library files in FFTW_DIR/lib.
  CFITSIO_DIR='' specifies the root location of CFITSIO  The header files should be in
           CFITSIO_DIR/include and the library files in CFITSIO_DIR/lib.
  BOOST_DIR='' specifies the root location of BOOST  The header files should be in
           BOOST_DIR/include/boost and the library files in BOOST_DIR/lib.
  EXTRA_INCLUDE_PATH='' specifies extra directories in which to search for 
           header files in addition to the standard locations such as /usr/include and 
           /usr/local/include and the ones derived from the above options.  
	   Sometimes the above options don't quite work, so you may need to specify 
	   other locations, which is what this option is for.  These directories are 
	   specified as -I flags to the compiler.  If you are giving multiple directories,
	   they should be separated by colons.
  EXTRA_LIB_PATH='' specifies extra directories in which to search for libraries
           in addition to the standard locations such as /usr/lib and /usr/local/lib.
	   These directories are specified as -L flags to the linker.  If you are giving 
           multiple directories, they should be separated by colons.
  EXTRA_PATH='' specifies directories in which to search for executables (notably the 
           compiler, although you can also just give the full path in the CXX parameter) 
	   in addition to the standard locations such as /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin.  
	   If you are giving multiple directories, they should be separated by colons.
  IMPORT_PATHS=false specifies whether to import extra path directories from the 
           environment variables: PATH, C_INCLUDE_PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH.
	   If you have a complicated setup in which you use these environment variables to 
	   control everything, this can be an easy way to let SCons know about these 
	   locations.
  IMPORT_ENV=true specifies whether to import the entire environment from the calling 
           shell.  The default is for SCons to use the same environment as the shell from 
	   which it is called.  However, sometimes it can be useful to start with a clean 
	   environment and manually add paths for various things, in which case you would 
	   want to set this to false.
  EXTRA_LIBS='' specifies libraries to use in addition to what SCons finds on
           its own.  This might be useful if you have a non-standard name for one of 
	   the external libraries.  e.g. If you want to use the Intel MKL library for
	   the fftw3 library, SCons won't automatically try that, so you could add those
	   libraries here.  If there is more than one, they should be quoted with 
	   spaces between the different libraries.  e.g. 
	   EXTRA_LIBS = "mkl_intel mkl_intel_thread mkl_core"

Miscellaneous flags:

  CACHE_LIB=true specifies whether to cache the results of the library checks
           While you are working one getting the prerequisites installed properly, it can
	   be useful to set this to false to force SCons to redo all of its library checks
	   each time.  Once you have a successful build, you should set it back to true
	   so that later builds can skip those checks.
  WITH_PROF=false specifies whether to use the compiler flag -pg to include profiling
           info for gprof.
  MEM_TEST=false specifies whether to test the code for memory leaks.
  TMV_DEBUG=false specifies whether to turn on extra (slower) debugging statements 
           within the TMV library.
