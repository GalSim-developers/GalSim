Changes from v2.1 to v2.2
=========================

Deprecated Features
-------------------

API Changes
-----------

- Removed functionality to store and re-load WFIRST PSFs, and to obtain multiple WFIRST
  PSFs simultaneously. (#919)

New Features
------------
- Updated WFIRST WCS and PSF routines to use Cycle 7 specifications for detector configurations,
  pupil planes, and aberrations. In particular, there is now a different
  pupil plane image for shorter- and longer-wavelength bands.  (#919)
- Enabled Zernikes up to 22 (previously 11) in WFIRST PSFs, and added dependence on position
  within the SCA. (#919)
- Added WFIRST fermi persistence model. (#992)
- Added `r0_500` argument to VonKarman. (#1005)
- Added array versions of `wcs.toWorld` and `wcs.toImage`. (#1026)

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed error in `wcs.makeSkyImage` when crossing ra=0 line for some WCS classes. (#1030)
