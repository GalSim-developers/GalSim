Changes from v0.3 to current version: 
------------------------------------

* When making GSObjects out of real images that have noise, it is possible to pad those images with
  a noise field (either correlated or uncorrelated) so that there is not an abrupt change of
  properties in the noise field when crossing the border into the padding region.  (Issue #238)

* Option for shears from a power spectrum: use a tabulated P(k), either input as arrays or read in from a
  file, for example from a cosmological shear power spectrum calculator.  Also, the PowerSpectrum class
  now properly handles conversions between different units for P(k) and the galaxy positions at
  which we are calculating shear.  Finally, an important bug in how the shears were generated from
  the power spectrum (which resulted in issues with overall normalization) was fixed. (Issue #305)

* An optimization of the InterpolatedImage constructor.  (Issue #305)

* A work-around for a pyfits bug that made our Rice-compressed output files (using pyfits)
  unreadable by ds9.  (Issue #305)

* There is now a python interface to C++ tables that can be used for interpolation in a more general
  context. (Issue #305)

* Added an addNoiseSNR() method to Image classes that adds noise such that the image has a 
  specified signal-to-noise ratio. (Issue #349)

* Made a new Noise hierarchy, and moved CCDNoise to that rather than have it be a BaseDeviate.
  There are also now GaussianNoise, PoissonNoise, and DeviateNoise classes. (Issue #349)
