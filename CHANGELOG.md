Changes from v1.6 to v2.0
=========================

The principal change in GalSim 2.0 is that it is now pip installable.
See the updated INSTALL file for details on how to install GalSim using
either pip or setup.py.  The functionality is essentially equivalent to
v1.6, although there are a few (mostly minor) API changes in some classes.

Dependency Changes
------------------

- Officially no longer support Python 2.6. (#755)
- No longer support pre-astropy versions of pyfits (now bundled in astropy
  as astropy.io.fits).  Nor astropy versions <1.0. (#755)
- No longer support pre-2016 version of the COSMOS catalog.  You may be
  asked to run galsim_download_cosmos again if your version is found to
  be obsolete. (#755)
- Added LSSTDESC.Coord, which contains the functionality that used to be in
  GalSim as the Angle and CelestialCoord classes.  We moved it to a separate
  repo so people could more easily use this functionality without requiring all
  of GalSim as a dependency. (#809b)
- Removed dependency on boost. (#809)
- Removed dependency on TMV. (#809)
- Added dependency on pybind11.  (You can still use boost if you want using
  the SCons installation method.) (#809)
- Added dependency on Eigen. (You can still use TMV if you want using the
  SCons installation method.) (#809)
- FFTW is now the only dependency that pip cannot handle automatically. (#809)


API Changes
-----------

- Changed the default maximum_fft_size in GSParams to 8192 from 4096.  This
  increases the potential memory used by an FFT when drawing an object with
  an FFT from 256 MB to 1 GB. (#755)
- Changed the order of arguments of galsim.wfirst.allDetectorEffects. (#755)
- Most of the functionality associated with C++-layer objects has been
  redesigned or removed.  These were non-public-API features, so if you have
  been using the public API, you should be fine.  But if you have been relying
  on features of the exposed C++-layer, this might break your code. (#809)
- There were some minor API changes to the Angle and CelestialCoord classes we
  made when we moved it over into LSSTDESC.Coord.  Some were to sever (weak)
  ties to other GalSim classes and some were just deemed API improvements.
  Most of these were already deprecated in v1.5.  The ones that we were not
  able to deprecate (and preserve the existing functionality) in advance of
  v2.0 are the `CelestialCoord.project` and `deproject` functions.  The new
  functionality has better units handing (taking and returning Angles rather
  then PositionD instances).  If you have been using these functions, you
  should check the new doc strings for the appropriate types and units for the
  parameters and return values. (#809b)
- The return type of a LookupTable when given a list or tuple input is now a
  numpy array rather than a list or tuple. (#809e)
- The return type of Bandpass and SED calls when given a list or tuple input
  is also now a numpy array. (#809e)
- Similarly, the output of getShear, getConvergence and similar methods of
  NFWHalo and PowerSpectrum are always either scalars or numpy arrays. (#809e)
- The attribute half_light_radius of both InclinedExponential and
  InclinedSersic has been changed to disk_half_light_radius, since it does
  not really correspond to the realized half-light radius of the inclined
  profile (unless the inclination angle is 0 degrees). (#809f)
- Removed galsim_yaml and galsim_json scripts, which were essentially just
  aliases for galsim -f yaml and galsim -f json respectively. (#809f)
- Removed lsst module, which depended on the LSST stack and had gotten quite
  out of sync and broken. (#964)


Bug Fixes
---------
=======
- Removed the lsst module, which depended on the LSST stack and had gotten
  quite out of sync and broken. (#964)
>>>>>>> Change default maximum_fft_size to 8192


Deprecated Features
-------------------

- Removed all features deprecated in 1.x versions.


New Features
------------

- Added a new class hierarchy for exceptions raised by GalSim with the base
  class `GalSimError`, a subclass of `RuntimeError`.  This provides a hook for
  adding sub-classes, which may provide more specific information about the
  nature of an error.  So far, sub-classes include GalSimHSMError for errors
  during HSM measurements and GalSimRangeError for attempted use of input
  parameters outside of allowed ranges. (#755)
- Changed the type of warnings raised by GalSim to GalSimWarning, which is
  a subclass of UserWarning. (#755)
