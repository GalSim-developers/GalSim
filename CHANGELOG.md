Changes from v1.1 to v1.2
=========================

Note: v1.2 is the official version we are tying the GalSim paper to.
(Nearly published -- we are responding to the referee report now!)
A few of the changes herein were made to address perceived deficiencies 
we noticed as we were writing the paper.

New Features
------------

- Changed name of noise whitening routine from noise.applyWhiteningTo(image)
  to image.whitenNoise(noise), parallel to image.addNoise(noise); use of
  noise.applyWhiteningTo() is deprecated. (#529)
- Added an option to impose N-fold symmetry (for user-selected even values of
  N>=4) on the noise in images with correlated noise rather than fully whiten
  the noise called image.symmetrizeNoise(noise, N). (#529)
- Added magnitudes as a method to set the flux of SED objects. (#547)
- Added SED.calculateDCRMomentShifts and SED.calculateChromaticSeeingRatio
  convenience functions for estimating chromatic PSF moment shifts. (#547)
- Added new methods of the image class to simulate two detector effects:
  nonlinearity and reciprocity failure. (#552)
- Renamed the GSParams parameter `alias_threshold` to `folding_threshold`, a
  clearer term for the profile image folding in real space that this GSParam
  controls. (#562)
- Modified the internals of noise generation by correlated noise models to use
  Hermitian symmetry, for greater efficiency. (#563)
- Extended to the `rotate`, `shear`, and `transform` methods of ChromaticObject
  the ability to take functions of wavelength for the arguments. (#581)
- Added a module to describe charge deflection in CCD pixels (also known as the
  "brighter-fatter" effect) following model of Antilogus et al (2014). (#524)
- Make it possible for OpticalPSF to model non-trivially complicated
  obscuration and/or struts by allowing it to take an optional image of the
  pupil plane. (#601)
- Added `nx`, `ny`, and `bounds` keywords to drawImage() and drawKImage()
  methods. (#603)
- Added `InterpolatedChromaticObject` class that can facilitate faster drawing
  compared to brute force for chromatic objects with basic properties that are
  wavelength-dependent (e.g., optical PSFs).  However, it can also be used to
  carry out the brute force comparison for easy accuracy tests.  New
  `ChromaticOpticalPSF` method takes advantage of the
  `InterpolatedChromaticObject` class, allowing the diffraction limit and
  aberrations to be wavelength-dependent. (#618)

Bug Fixes and Improvements
--------------------------

- Modified BoundsI and PositionI initialization to ensure that integer elements
  in NumPy arrays with `dtype==int` are handled without error. (#486)
- Changed the default seed used for Deviate objects when no seed is given to
  use /dev/urandom if it is available. If not, it reverts to the old behavior
  of using the current time to generate a seed value. (#537)
- Changed SED and Bandpass methods that return a new SED or Bandpass to attempt
  to preserve the type of the calling object if it is a subclass of SED or
  Bandpass respectively. (#547)
- Changed the the `file_name` argument to `CorrelatedNoise.getCOSMOSNoise()` to
  no longer be required. The normal file to use is now installed along with
  GalSim (in the directory PREFIX/share/galsim), so that file can be used by
  default. (#548)
- Fixed the `dtype=` kwarg used when initializing `Image` instances to
  interpret the aliases `int` and `float` as the `numpy.int32` and
  `numpy.float64` data types, respectively. Previously the behavior was
  unpredictable and platform dependent. (#571)
- Added workaround for bug in pyfits 3.0 that affected `galsim.fits.read`.
  (#572)
- Fixed the Image constructor so that if it is passed a NumPy array with the
  opposite byteorder as the native one on the system, it does not return an
  Image with different contents. (#594)
- Fixed bug that prevented calling LookupTables on non-square 2d arrays. (#599)
- Updated the code to account for a planned change in NumPy that `array==None`
  will be an element-wise comparison rather than equivalent to `array is None`.
  (#604)
- Fixed a bug where the dtype of an Image could change when resizing, which
  should not be the case. (#604)
- Defined a hidden `__version__` attribute according to PEP 8 standards. (#610)

Updates to config options
-------------------------

- Moved noise whitening option from being an attribute of the RealGalaxy class,
  to being a part of the description of the noise. (#529)
- Added RandomPoisson, RandomBinomial, RandomWeibull, RandomGamma, and
  RandomChi2 random number generators, corresponding to the random deviate
  classes in the python layer. (#537)
