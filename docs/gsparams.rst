The GSParams class
==================

As mentioned in the `GSObject` docstring, all of the various `GSObject` classes take an optional
``gsparams`` argument, which can be used to specify various numbers that govern the tradeoff
between accuracy and speed for the calculations made in drawing a GSObject.  The numbers are
encapsulated in a class called `GSParams`.
