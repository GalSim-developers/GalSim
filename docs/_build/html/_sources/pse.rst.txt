Power Spectrum Estimation
=========================

The ``galsim.pse`` module was developed largely by Joe Zuntz and tweaked by assorted GalSim
developers.  This development and testing of this module took place in a separate (private)
repository before the code was moved into the GalSim repository, but there are some demonstrations
of the performance of this code in devel/modules/lensing_engine.pdf.
