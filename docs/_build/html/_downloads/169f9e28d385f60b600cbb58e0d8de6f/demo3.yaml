# This script gets reasonably close to including all the principal features of an image
# from a ground-based telescope.  The galaxy is represented as the sum of a bulge and a disk,
# where each component is represented by a sheared Sersic profile (with different Sersic
# indices).  The PSF has both atmospheric and optical components.  The atmospheric
# component is a Kolmogorov turbulent spectrum. The optical component includes defocus,
# coma and astigmatism, as well as obscuration from a secondary mirror.  The noise model
# includes both a gain and read noise.  And finally, we include the effect of a slight
# telescope distortion.
#
# New features introduced in this demo:

# Define the galaxy profile
gal :
    # This galaxy will be the sum of a bulge component and a disk component
    type : Sum

    # Any number of items may be added together, so we specify them in a list.
    # Use one bullet for each item.
    # Note: Each item in the Sum can have its own separate shear.  See demo4 for an example.
    items :
        # Note the notation here for a list of items rather than a dict of key:value pairs.
        # Each item is specified by an indented -.  Then another layer of indentation is
        # required for the key:value pairs for each item.
        -   # First the bulge:
            type : Sersic
            n : 3.5
            half_light_radius : 2.3  # arcsec
            flux : 0.3  # flux here is used to mean "fractional flux"

        -   # Now the disk:
            type : Sersic
            n : 1.5
            # Normally Sersic profiles are specified by half-light radius, the radius that
            # encloses half of the total flux.  However, for some purposes, it can be
            # preferable to instead specify the scale radius, where the surface brightness
            # drops to 1/e of the central peak value.
            scale_radius : 0.85  # arcsec (corresponds to half_light_radius of ~3.7 arcsec)
            flux : 0.7

    # A shear at this level applies to the summed profile
    shear :
        # QBeta means to use the axis ratio (q = b/a) and a position angle.
        type : QBeta
        q : 0.73
        # For angles, you must let GalSim know which units you intend.
        # So the number must be followed by either degrees or radians
        # (or arcminutes or arcseconds if you prefer).
        # These may be abbreviated to deg and rad (and arcmin, arcsec).
        beta : 23 degrees

    # The flux here also applies to the full galaxy object.
    flux : 1.e6  # ADU ("Analog-to-digital units", the units of the numbers on a CCD)


# Define the PSF profile
psf :
    # This PSF will be the convolution of an atmospheric component and an optical component.
    type : Convolution

    # Any number of items may be convolved together, so just like for Sum,
    # we specify them in a list.
    items :
        -
            # For the atmospheric component, we use a Kolmogorov spectrum
            type : Kolmogorov
            fwhm : 2.1  # arcsec

            # An ellip at this level just applies to this component.
            ellip:
                type : EBeta
                e : 0.13
                beta : 0.81 radians

        -
            # For the optical component, GalSim provides an OpticalPSF class that
            # implements the PSF pattern from various telescope aberrations.
            type : OpticalPSF

            # Use value for lambda = 800 nm, D = 4 m
            # lam_over_diam = (800 nm) * 1.e-9 (m/nm) / (4m) * (206265 arcsec/radian)
            #               = 0.041253 arcsec

            # The rest of these values are given in units of lambda
            defocus : 0.53
            astig1 : -0.29
            astig2 : 0.12
            coma1 : 0.64

# Define some other information about the images
image :
    pixel_scale : 0.23   # arcsec / pixel
    size : 64  # pixels in each direction
    # (You can also specify xsize and ysize separately for non-square images.)

    # You may provide a World Coordinate System (WCS) transformation to be applied
    # to the image.  In this case, we simply have a constant telescope distortion
    # over the image.  See the config wiki page for a list of all the allowed WCS
    # types and their parameters.  (We'll use two others in demo9 and demo11.)
    wcs :
        type : Shear
        shear :
            type : G1G2
            g1 : -0.02

    noise :
        # The CCD noise type has the potential to be more sophisticated than just a
        # simple Poisson noise according to the flux of sky + object.
        # You can also specify a gain and a read_noise for the CCD.
        # The gain indicates how many photons (or electrons, technically) correspond
        # to each final ADU.  And the read_noise is an additional Gaussian noise
        # (specified as the sigma or rms value) also in unit of electrons.
        type : CCD
        sky_level : 2.5e4  # ADU / arcsec^2
        gain : 1.7  # e- / ADU
        read_noise : 0.3  # e- / pixel


    # If you want the random values used to be deterministic, you can provide an initial seed.
    # If this isn't set, then it will use the current time to create an initial seed.

# Define the name and format of the output file
output :

    # Sometimes it is useful to have the PSF image also written to a file.
    # The PSF image will always have the same pixel centering as the galaxy, and if there
    # was any random component to the PSF generation, then this will be the exact same PSF
    # that was used for the galaxy.  Plus, there is no noise in the PSF image.
    psf :
        # You may either specify a new file_name as we do here, or you can specify
        # 'hdu' to put the PSF image in the same fits file, but in another HDU.
