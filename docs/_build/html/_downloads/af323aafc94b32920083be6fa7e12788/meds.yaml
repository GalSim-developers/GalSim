# A simulation based on the Great3 rgc branch, but tailored to DES specifics including
# outputing to MEDS files.
#
# For the psf, we use a combination of Kolmogorov for the atmospheric component, and an
# OpticalPSF for the optics, using parameters appropriate for DECam and the Blanco telescope.
#
# The galaxies are real galaxies from the COSMOS catalog using the I<25.2 sample.
#
# For the wcs, we use a random location within a full DES focal plane, which we take from 62
# images files from SV data.  We don't include these files in the repo, since they total about
# 700 MB.  You can download a tarball with the files used by this script at
#
#    http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~mjarvis/des_data.html
#
# The output files are MEDS files using the new psf extension to store images of the
# PSF, so no interpolation is necessary.  In this sim, the PSF is actually a constant, but
# when we start making the PSF variable, this will be useful.
#
# Notably, this config file uses a couple of custom types, the code for which is also in this
# directory in the files hsm_shape.py and des_wcs.py.  So this serves as an example for how to
# write custom extensions to the GalSim config apparatus.

modules:
    # The GalSim config processor will import each of these at the start of processing this
    # file, so it provides a way to have custom types for anything (values, objects, inputs,
    # output files, etc.).  In this case, two of these are in the current directory, so if
    # you run `galsim meds.yaml` in this directory, it will find them.  But they can be anywhere
    # in your PYTHONPATH.

    # Use the extra features from the galsim.des module
    - galsim.des

    # A custom package in this directory for measuring shapes with HSM
    - hsm_shape

    # Read the WCS from a (in this case random) location within a real DES focal place observation.
