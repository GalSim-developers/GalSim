Demo #12

The twelfth script in our tutorial about using GalSim in python scripts: examples/demo*.py.
(This file is designed to be viewed in a window 100 characters wide.)

This script introduces wavelength-dependent profiles. Three kinds of chromatic profiles are
demonstrated here:

1) A chromatic object representing a DeVaucouleurs galaxy with an early-type SED at redshift 0.8.
   The galaxy is drawn using the six LSST filters, which demonstrate that the galaxy is a g-band
   dropout.

2) A two-component bulge+disk galaxy, in which the bulge and disk have different SEDs.

3) A wavelength-dependent atmospheric PSF, which includes the effect of differential chromatic
   refraction and the wavelength dependence of Kolmogorov-turbulence-induced seeing.  This PSF
   is convolved with a simple Exponential galaxy.

In all three cases, six images are created, which correspond to each of the LSST filters:
u, g, r, i, z, and Y.  We also provide suggested parameters for viewing in ds9.

New features introduced in this demo:

- SED = galsim.SED(wave, flambda, wave_type, flux_type)
- SED2 = SED.atRedshift(redshift)
- bandpass = galsim.Bandpass(filename, wave_type)
- bandpass2 = bandpass.truncate(relative_throughput)
- bandpass3 = bandpass2.thin(rel_err)
- gal = GSObject * SED
- obj = galsim.Add([list of ChromaticObjects])
- ChromaticObject.drawImage(bandpass)
- PSF = galsim.ChromaticAtmosphere(GSObject, base_wavelength, zenith_angle)

    # For a ground-based PSF, two chromatic effects are introduced by the atmosphere:
    # (i) differential chromatic refraction (DCR), and (ii) wavelength-dependent seeing.
    #
    # DCR shifts the position of the PSF as a function of wavelength.  Blue light is shifted
    # toward the zenith slightly more than red light.
    #
    # Kolmogorov turbulence in the atmosphere leads to a seeing size (e.g., FWHM) that scales with
    # wavelength to the (-0.2) power.
    #
    # The ChromaticAtmosphere function will attach both of these effects to a fiducial PSF at
    # some fiducial wavelength.

    # First we define a monochromatic PSF to be the fiducial PSF.
    PSF_500 = galsim.Moffat(beta=2.5, fwhm=0.5)
    # Then we use ChromaticAtmosphere to manipulate this fiducial PSF as a function of wavelength.
    # ChromaticAtmosphere also needs to know the wavelength of the fiducial PSF, and the location
    # and orientation of the object with respect to the zenith.  This final piece of information
    # can be specified in several ways (see the ChromaticAtmosphere docstring for all of them).

    HA = -1.0 * galsim.hours # Hour angle = one hour before transit

    # Then we can compute the zenith angle and parallactic angle (which is is the position angle
    # of the zenith measured from North through East) of this object:
    za, pa = galsim.dcr.zenith_parallactic_angles(m101, HA=HA, latitude=latitude)
