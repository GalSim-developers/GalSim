# Demo #6
#
# The sixth YAML configuration file in our tutorial about using Galsim config files
# (This file is designed to be viewed in a window 100 characters wide.)
#
# This script uses real galaxy images from COSMOS observations.  The catalog of real galaxy
# images distributed with GalSim only includes 100 galaxies, but you can download a much
# larger set of images.  See https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim/wiki for a link
# to the download page.
#
# The galaxy images are already convolved with the effective PSF for the original observations,
# so GalSim considers the galaxy profile to be the observed image deconvolved by that PSF
# (also distributed with the galaxy data).  In this case, we then randomly rotate the galaxies,
# apply a given gravitational shear as well as gravitational magnification, and then finally
# convolve by a double Gaussian PSF.  The final image can of course have any pixel scale, not
# just that of the original images.  The output for this script is to a FITS "data cube".
# With DS9, this can be viewed with a slider to quickly move through the different images.
#
# New features introduced in this demo:
#
# - input : real_catalog (file_name, dir, image_dir)
# - obj type : RealGalaxy (index)
# - obj : rotate
# - obj : magnify
# - image : sky_level
# - image : offset
# - value type : Sequence (first, last, step)
# - output type : DataCube (file_name, dir, nimages)
#
# - Using YAML's multiple document feature to do more than one thing


# In this file, we use yaml's multiple documents feature.
# This can be useful if you are doing similar things, but have a couple differences
# for the different output files.
# In this case, we output the PSF image in the first document, and the data cube of the galaxies
# in the second document.

# The multiple yaml documents are separated by a line with three dashes "---"
# The first document has all the parts that are common to all the output files.
# Then each subsequent document defines its particular additions to that base.
# These are combined with the first document's information for processing.
# So if we start numbering the documents at 0, we effectively process:
#   doc[0] + doc[1]
#   doc[0] + doc[2]
#   doc[0] + doc[3]
#   ...

# So start with the common information:

# Define the PSF profile
psf :
    type : Sum
    items :
        # Note: in this case, each item is small enough that we can put the whole dict on a
        # single line with the -.  No need for further indentation.
        - { type : Gaussian, fwhm : 0.6, flux : 0.8 }
        - { type : Gaussian, fwhm : 2.3, flux : 0.2 }


# Define some other information about the images
image :
    # The pixel size applies to both outputs, so put that here in the first document.
    pixel_scale : 0.16  # arcsec / pixel

    # This time, we'll leave the size unspecified to let GalSim automatically choose
    # an appropriate size.  So no image : size item.


---

# The first specialization document is for the PSF output.

# Define the name and format of the output file
output :
    dir : output_yaml
    file_name : psf_real.fits

---

# The next document is for the galaxy output.

# Define the galaxy profile
gal :
    type : RealGalaxy
    flux : 1.e5

    index :
        type : Sequence
        # Sequence can optionally take first, last, and step, however, the defaults
        # are fine here:
        #   first = 0
        #   last = <num entries in catalog> - 1
        #   step = 1
        # If the sequential values exceed last, they will repeat back starting at first, so it's
        # ok to have nobjects greater than the number of real galaxies in the catalog.

    rotate :
        # An angle of type Random means uniform within 0 .. 2pi radians
        type : Random

    shear :
        type : G1G2
        g1 : -0.027
        g2 : 0.031

    # Also apply a magnification mu = ( (1-kappa)^2 - |gamma|^2 )^-1
    # This conserves surface brightness, so it scales both the area and flux.
    magnify : 1.082

# Define some other information about the images
image :

    # If we specify the sky_level as an image attribute, it will be used
    # as a background level for the image.  (The background level per pixel is
    # 1.e6 * (0.15)^2 = 2250.)
    sky_level : 1.e6  # ADU / arcsec^2

    # Since we already specified a sky_level for the whole image, we don't need
    # to repeat it for the noise.  So in fact, everything is default here.
    # So we can just set the noise to an empty dictionary, which means use all defaults.
    # (If we omit it entirely, that would mean no noise, which isn't what we want.)
    #
    # Also, if we include a sky_level in noise in addition to the above image sky_level,
    # then both of them (added together) will be used for the noise, but only the
    # image.sky_level will remain as the background level in the final image.
    noise : {}

    # We can also offset the object from the center of the image.  We had previously
    # (in demo4 and demo5) used galaxy.shift as a way to shift the center of the image.
    # Since that is applied to the galaxy, the units are arcsec (since the galaxy profile
    # itself doesn't know about the pixel scale).  Here, the offset applies to the drawn
    # image, which does know about the pixel scale, so the units of offset are pixels,
    # not arcsec.  Here, we apply an offset of up to half a pixel in each direction.
    offset :
        type : XY
        x : { type : Random, min : -0.5, max : 0.5 }
        y : { type : Random, min : -0.5, max : 0.5 }

    random_seed : 1512413

    # Note: since the output includes a data_cube output, which requires all the
    # images to be the same size, GalSim will choose the size of the first image
    # automatically from the profile (since we aren't setting any image : size here),
    # but then subsequent images will be forced to be the same size as the first one.


# Define the input files
input :
    # In this case, we need to define where the real galaxy input catalog is.
    # Note: dir is the directory both for the catalog itself and also the directory prefix
    # for the image files listed in the catalog.
    # If the images are in a different directory, you may also specify image_dir, which gives
    # the relative path from dir to wherever the images are located.
    real_catalog :
        dir : data
        file_name : real_galaxy_catalog_23.5_example.fits


# Define the name and format of the output file
output :
    type : DataCube
    dir : output_yaml
    file_name : cube_real.fits
    nimages : 100
