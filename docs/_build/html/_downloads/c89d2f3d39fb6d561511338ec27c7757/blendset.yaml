# A simulation of sets of blended galaxies written to a MEDS file.
# As in blend.yaml, there are two output files, one with the blended images and one with
# the neighbors removed.  i.e. what you might get from a perfect deblender.
# This time each galaxy in the set is given a postage stamp where it is at the center.
# The same noise realization is used for each full set of blended objects, so this corresponds
# to multiple cutouts from a larger image where each detection is at the center, as you would
# get for a normal MEDS file from real data.

modules:
    # Use the extra features from the galsim.des module
    - galsim.des

    # A module in this directory that defines some custom types related to blending
    - blend

    # Another module in this directory that defines the ExcludedRandom type
    - excluded_random

psf:
    # Use a PSFEx PSF as measured from DES SV data.
    type: DES_PSFEx

    # The image_pos doesn't matter much for the MEDS output, but it is used to get the
    # right PSF from the PSFEx file.
    image_pos :
        type : XY

gal:
    # Choose random galaxies from the COSMOS catalog.
    type: COSMOSGalaxy
    index: { type: Random }

    # Either of these will work here, but the real galaxies are much slower on such a small
    # simulation, since they require a lot of setup time to read in each of the RealGalaxy
    # image files.  On a typically large simulation, this time gets amortized over a lot
    # of objects, so the difference isn't as huge.  So to keep the running time reasonable,
    # we use parameteric here.
    gal_type: parametric
    #gal_type: real

    # Randomly spin the original profile
    rotate: { type: Random }

    # This works out about right for the sky level we chose below.  The galaxies mostly seem
    # to have pretty decent S/N based on visual inspection of image.

stamp:
    # In blend.py (loaded by the modules field above), we define a custom stamp type
    # called BlendSet.
    # The first stamp is similar to what we did in blend.yaml with the stamp type Blend.
    # It has one galaxy centered (more or less -- cf image.offset) on the stamp, and then
    # some number of neighbors also appearing on the stamp placed randomly within some range
    # of allowed separations.
    # However, then BlendSet repeats the image n_neighbors more times centering on each of the
    # neighbors in turn.
    type: BlendSet

    # Up to 5 neighbors.  Each neighbor has a prob of p=0.3 of being included.
    n_neighbors:
        type: RandomBinomial
        N: 5
        p: 0.3

    # The neighbors cannot be too close (assume they are rejected as unusable) or too far
    # (not really a blend).
    min_sep: 2   # arcsec -- clearly overlapping.  Too hard to deblend.
    max_sep: 10  # arcsec -- this would be off the edge of the stamp.  Not really blended.

    # Offset is just random within central pixel.
    offset:
        type: XY
        x: { type: Random, min: -0.5, max: 0.5 }
        y: { type: Random, min: -0.5, max: 0.5 }
