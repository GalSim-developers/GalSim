# A simulation of blended pairs of galaxies at various separations and flux ratios.
# There are two parallel runs, one normal and the other where the neighbor only contributes
# to the noise, not the flux.  So this simulates a perfect deblender that removes the flux
# correctly, but there is still the extra noise from the neighbor.

modules:

    # A module in this directory that defines some custom types related to blending
    - blend

    # A module that defines the LogNormal distribution.
    # This optionally uses the ngmix module: https://github.com/esheldon/ngmix
    # to show how that can work.  But if you don't have it, it has its own implementation
    # as well (since it's pretty simple).

    # Simple Moffat PSF

                # http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993MNRAS.264..961S

    # This means the psf should change per output file, not per object as would be the default.

stamp:
    # In blend.py (loaded by the modules field above), we define a custom stamp type
    # called Blend.
    # It has one galaxy centered (more or less -- cf image.offset) on the stamp, and then
    # some number of neighbors also appearing on the stamp placed randomly within some range
    # of allowed separations.
    type: Blend

    # Up to 5 neighbors.  Each neighbor has a probability p=0.3 of being included.
    n_neighbors:
        type: RandomBinomial
        N: 5
        p: 0.3

    # The neighbors cannot be too close (assume they are rejected as unusable) or too far
    # (not really a blend).
    min_sep: 2   # arcsec -- clearly overlapping.  Too hard to deblend.
    max_sep: 10  # arcsec -- this would be off the edge of the stamp.  Not really blended.

    # Offset is just random within central pixel.
    offset:
        type: XY

        # final image that includes all the noise.  So the Poisson noise of the neighbors
        # is still there.  Just not any of the flux from the neighbors.
        # This represents the result of a perfect deblender.
