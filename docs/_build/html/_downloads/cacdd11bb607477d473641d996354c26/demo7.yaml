# Demo #7

# The seventh YAML configuration file in our tutorial about using Galsim config files
# (This file is designed to be viewed in a window 100 characters wide.)
#
# This script introduces drawing profiles with photon shooting rather than doing the
# convolution with an FFT.  It makes images using 5 different kinds of PSF and 5 different
# kinds of galaxy.  Some of the parameters (flux, size and shape) are random variables, so
# each of the 25 pairings is drawn 4 times with different realizations of the random numbers.
# The profiles are drawn twice: once with the FFT method, and once with photon shooting.
# The two images are drawn side by side into the same larger image so it is easy to
# visually compare the results. The 100 total profiles are written to a FITS data cube,
# which makes it easy to scroll through the images comparing the two drawing methods.
#
# New features introduced in this demo:
#
# - obj type : List (items)
# - obj type : Airy (lam_over_diam)
# - obj type : Sersic (..., trunc)
# - obj : dilate
# - value type : Sequence (..., repeat, index_key)
# - value type : Random (min, max)
# - image type : Tiled (..., stamp_size, xborder, yborder)
# - stamp : draw_method (fft or phot)
# - stamp : gsparams
# - output : file_name with .gz, .bz2 or .fz extension automatically uses compression.

    # The max_extra_noise parameter indicates how much extra noise per pixel we are
    # willing to tolerate as a fraction of the noise that we will be adding from the

    # but only for photon shooting.  We use None here when the draw_method is fft.

    # This script is set up as a comparison between using FFTs for doing the convolutions and
    # shooting photons.  The two methods have trade-offs in speed and accuracy which vary
    # with the kind of profile being drawn and the S/N of the object, among other factors.
    # In addition, for each method, there are a number of parameters GalSim uses that control
    # aspects of the calculation that further affect the speed and accuracy.
    #
    # These parametsrs can be adjusted from the defaults with a gsparams item, either in
    # image (in which case the values apply to all objects) or in the gal or psf layer
    # in which case the values apply to just that object.  For this script, we just apply a
    # global change to some of the values, just to demonstrate how it works.
