# Demo #11
#
# The eleventh YAML configuration file in our tutorial about using Galsim config files.
# (This file is designed to be viewed in a window 100 characters wide.)
#
# This script uses a constant PSF from real data (an image read in from a bzipped FITS file,
# not a parametric model) and variable shear and magnification according to some cosmological
# model for which we have a tabulated shear power spectrum at specific k values only.  The 288
# galaxies in the 0.1 x 0.1 degree field (representing a number density of 8/arcmin^2)
# are randomly located and permitted to overlap. For the galaxies, we use a mix of real and
# parametric galaxies modeled off the COSMOS observations with the Hubble Space Telescope.
# The real galaxies are similar to those used in demo10.  The parametric galaxies are based
# on parametric fits to the same observed galaxies.  The flux and size distribution are thus
# realistic for an I < 23.5 magnitude limited sample.

# New features introduced in this demo:
#
# - obj type : InterpolatedImage(image, scale)
# - obj type : COSMOSGalaxy
# - obj : scale_flus
# - stamp : draw_method (no_pixel)
# - input : power_spectrum (e_power_file, delta2, units)
# - input : cosmos_catalog (file_name, dir, use_real)
# - image : index_convention
# - image.noise : whiten
# - image.noise : symmetrize
# - wcs type : Tan(dudx, dudy, dvdx, dvdy, units, origin, ra, dec)
# - top level field eval_variables
#
# - Power spectrum shears and magnifications for non-gridded positions.
# - Reading a compressed FITS image (using BZip2 compression).
# - Writing a compressed FITS image (using Rice compression).
# - Using $ as shorthand for Eval type.
#

# Sometimes there are variables that you want to use in multiple Eval commands.
# Rather than defining the variable multiple times, once for each time you use it,
# GalSim allows you to put such variables in a special top-level field called eval_variables.
# Anything defined in eval_variables will be available for all Eval commands, so you don't
# have to repeat them for each one.  In this case, pixel_scale and theta are used below in the
# Eval strings of dudx, dudy, dvdx, and dvdy for the field image.wcs.
#
# We've also seen (in demo4.yaml) that YAML lets you tag values with an & in one place and
# use them later with *.  It can be convenient to combine this notation with eval_variables
# to let you define all the useful variables near the top of the config file and use them
# either in Eval strings or as YAML tags.  Here, the only one we use both ways is pixel_scale,
# but we show it for all of them to give you the idea.
eval_variables :

    # pixel_scale = the pixel scale in arcsec.  Used in setting up the WCS.
    # The units for this doesn't have to be arcsec.  It is set by the wcs.units parameter.
    # Remember the first letter indicates what type each variable is.  Here f = float.
    fpixel_scale : &pixel_scale 0.2

    # theta = the angle we rotate the pixel coordinates with respect to RA/Dec coordinates.
    # An unusual prefix: a = Angle.
    atheta : &theta 0.17 degrees

    # tel_diam = the telescope diameter in meters.
    ftel_diam : &tel_diam 4

    # exp_time = the exposure time in seconds.
    fexp_time : &exp_time 300

    # image_size = size in pixels
    fimage_size : &image_size 2048

    # nobjects = number of objects per image
    # corresponds to 8 gal / arcmin^2
    inobjects : &nobjects 288

    # We also introduce here a shorthand notation for Eval types.  Whenever you just need
    # to evaluate a string, but don't need to define any extra variables here, you can
    # just use a string with a $ as the first character.  So the following is equivalent to:
    #
    # fsize_degrees:
    #     type : Eval
    #     str : "image_size * pixel_scale / 3600"
    #
    # For simple evaluations, this often makes the config file more readable.
    # This is a calculation of the size of the image in degrees, which we'll use below.
    # size in degrees = 2048 pixels * 0.2 arcsec/pixel / 3600 arcsec/deg = 0.114 deg
    fsize_degrees : '$image_size * pixel_scale / 3600'


# Define the PSF profile
psf :
    # We introduce here a new way to describe a profile.  We can use an image from a fits
    # file and interpolate between the pixels with type = InterpolatedImage.
    type : InterpolatedImage

    # The only required parameter is the name of the file with the image.  Note: the file is
    # bzipped, to demonstrate the new capability of reading in a file that has been compressed
    # in various ways (which GalSim can infer from the filename).
    image : "data/example_sdss_psf_sky0.fits.bz2"

    # If the fits file has a scale given in the header information, we can use that for
    # the pixel scale.  If it is not given it will assume 1.
    # Or we can also override that by providing an explicit pixel scale here.
    # This file is a real SDSS PSF, which means pixel scale of 0.396 arcsec.  However, the
    # typical seeing is 1.2 arcsec and we want to simulate better seeing, so we will just
    # tell GalSim that the pixel scale is 0.2 arcsec to match the pixel scale we use below.
    scale : *pixel_scale

# Define the galaxy profile
gal :

    # COSMOS galaxies are generated from a cosmos_catalog (see below).
    # They are based on the COSMOS field observed with HST.  The size and flux distribution
    # are appropriate for an I < 23.5 magnitude limited survey.
    type : COSMOSGalaxy

    # The COSMOS galaxies can be either "real", meaning they are based on the real COSMOS
    # image, including features like spiral arms, star-bursting regions, etc, or "parametric"
    # which means either a Sersic fit or a bulge plus disk fit (according to which one gave
    # the better chisq).  Here we use real 30% of the time, and parametric 70%.

            # probability p of getting heads.)  Here we have p = 0.3, so we get 'real' (index=0)

    # For real galaxies, we will want to whiten the noise in the image (below).
    # When whitening the image, we need to make sure the original correlated noise is
    # present throughout the whole image, otherwise the whitening will do the wrong thing
    # to the parts of the image that don't include the original image.  The RealGalaxy
    # stores the correct noise profile to use as the gal.noise attribute.  This noise
    # profile is automatically updated as we shear, dilate, convolve, etc.  But we need to
    # tell it how large to pad with this noise by hand.  This is a bit complicated for the
    # code to figure out on its own, so we have to supply the size for noise padding
    # with the noise_pad_size parameter.

    # The large galaxies will render fine without any noise padding, but the postage stamp
    # for the smaller galaxies will be sized appropriately for the PSF, which may make the
    # stamp larger than the original galaxy image.  The psf image is 40 x 40, although
    # the bright part is much more concentrated than that.  If we pad out the galaxy image
    # to at least 40 x sqrt(2), we should be safe even if the galaxy image is rotated
    # with respect to the psf image.
    #     noise_pad_size = 40 * sqrt(2) * 0.2 arcsec/pixel = 11.3 arcsec
    noise_pad_size : 11.3

    # We will select a galaxy at random from the catalog. One could easily do this by setting 
    # index : { type : Random }
    # but we will instead allow the catalog to choose a random galaxy for us.  It will remove any
    # selection effects involved in postage stamp creation using weights that are stored in the
    # catalog.  We employ this random selection by simply failing to specify an index or identifier
    # for a galaxy, in which case it chooses a random one.

    # The default convention on positions is to follow the FITS standard where the lower left
    # pixel is called (1,1).  However, this can be counter-intuitive to people more used
    # to C or python indexing, where indices start at 0.  So we offer the option of switching
    # the indexing convention.  This is probably only  useful if you are going to do something
    # non-trivial with the image_pos values.
    #
    # If index_convention is 0 or 'C' or 'python', then the lower-left pixel is (0,0).

    # The default is 1.

    # Add Gaussian noise.  When using the whitening feature, the whitening process will end
    # up with white Gaussian noise.  So adding more Gaussian noise can be done coherently.
    # Adding any other kind of noise (Poisson for instance) will actually result in some
    # Gaussian noise as well, with the total variance preserved.
    noise :
        type : Gaussian
        variance : 5.0e4   # Total variance including whatever the whitening process needs.

        # RealGalaxy objects have some noise already included in the original HST images.
        # This noise is stored with each object, and the propagated through all changes
        # (transformations, convolutions, etc.), which will correlate the noise.
        #
        # Once the process gets to the point of adding additional noise to the image, you
        # have a few options for what to do with this propagated noise.  The first option
        # is to do nothing, in which case GalSim will just ignore it and add the full
        # amount specified above as additional noise.  This is equivalent to treating the
        # noise that was in the original image as part of the true surface brightness
        # profile of the galaxy.
        #
        # Another option is to whiten the noise to get rid of the correlations.  This is
        # specified as whiten : True.  GalSim will add enough correlated noise to make the
        # resulting noise be white, then add more white noise to make the total variance
        # equal to the above specified value.
        #
        # However, this is often overkill for many applications.  If it is acceptable to
        # merely end up with noise with some degree of symmetry (say 4-fold or 8-fold
        # symmetry), then you can instead have GalSim just add enough noise to make the
        # resulting noise have this kind of symmetry.  Usually this requires adding
        # significantly less additional noise, which means you can have the resulting
        # total variance be somewhat smaller.  The above specified variance will then
        # correspond to the zero-lag value, since the noise will still have some
        # covariances.  This option is specified using symmetrize : N, where N is the
