    # confused by the noise in the image.  In GREAT3, we dealt with this by precomputing SNR values
    # using parametric galaxies models and using them even when calculating SNR for realistic
    # galaxies.  It is hard to imagine how to implement this here.
    # We could switch to using some kind of Gaussian-weighted SNR estimator for the realistic
    # galaxy branches perhaps.  But for now we just do the same calculation, but subtract off
    # the contribution of the original image noise from the calculation of sum(I(x,y)^2).
