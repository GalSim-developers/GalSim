# Demo #10
#
# The tenth YAML configuration file in our tutorial about using Galsim config files
# (This file is designed to be viewed in a window 100 characters wide.)
#
# This script uses both a variable PSF and variable shear, taken from a power spectrum, along
# the lines of a Great10 (Kitching, et al, 2012) image.  The galaxies are placed on a grid
# (10 x 10 in this case, rather than 100 x 100 in the interest of time.)  Each postage stamp
# is 48 x 48 pixels.  Instead of putting the PSF images on a separate image, we package them
# as the second HDU in the file.  For the galaxies, we use a random selection from 5 specific
# RealGalaxy objects, selected to be 5 particularly irregular ones.  (These are taken from
# the same catalog of 100 objects that demo6 used.)  The galaxies are oriented in a ring
# test (Nakajima & Bernstein 2007) of 20 each.  And we again output a truth catalog with the
# correct applied shear for each object (among other information).
#
# New features introduced in this demo:
#
# - stamp type : Ring (..., full_rotation)
# - obj type : RealGalaxy (..., id)
# - type : Eval using world_pos variable, user-defined variables and math functions
# - type : Current
# - shear_value : PowerSpectrumShear
# - pos_value : RTheta (r, theta)
# - image type : Tiled (..., order)
# - input : power_spectrum (e_power_function, b_power_function)
# - output.psf : hdu, signal_to_noise, draw_method, offset
# - output.truth : hdu
#
# - Evaluated values in output.truth.columns

        # object "on the sky" relative to the center of the image in arcsec.
        # This lets you define any arbitrary function for a particular variable in terms of (x,y).
