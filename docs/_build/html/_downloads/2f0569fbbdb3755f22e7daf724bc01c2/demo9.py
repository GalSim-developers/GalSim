Demo #9

The ninth script in our tutorial about using GalSim in python scripts: examples/demo*.py.
(This file is designed to be viewed in a window 100 characters wide.)

This script simulates cluster lensing or galaxy-galaxy lensing.  The gravitational shear
applied to each galaxy is calculated for an NFW halo mass profile.  We simulate observations
of galaxies around 20 different clusters -- 5 each of 4 different masses.  Each cluster
has its own file, organized into 4 directories (one for each mass).  For each cluster, we
draw 20 lensed galaxies located at random positions in the image.  The PSF is appropriate for a
space-like simulation.  (Some of the numbers used are the values for HST.)  And we apply
a cubic telescope distortion for the WCS.  Finally, we also output a truth catalog for each
output image that could be used for testing the accuracy of shape or flux measurements.

New features introduced in this demo:

- psf = OpticalPSF(lam, diam, ..., trefoil1, trefoil2, nstruts, strut_thick, strut_angle)
- im = galsim.ImageS(xsize, ysize, wcs)
- pos = galsim.PositionD(x, y)
- nfw = galsim.NFWHalo(mass, conc, z, omega_m, omega_lam)
- g1,g2 = nfw.getShear(pos, z)
- mag = nfw.getMagnification(pos, z)
- dist = galsim.DistDeviate(rng, function, x_min, x_max)
- pos = image.true_center
- wcs = galsim.UVFunction(ufunc, vfunc, xfunc, yfunc, origin)
- wcs.toWorld(profile, image_pos)
- wcs.makeSkyImage(image, sky_level)
- image_pos = wcs.toImage(pos)
- image.invertSelf()
- truth_cat = galsim.OutputCatalog(names, types)
- bounds.isDefined()

- Make multiple output files.
- Place galaxies at random positions on a larger image.
- Write a bad pixel mask and a weight image as the second and third HDUs in each file.
- Use multiple processes to construct each file in parallel.
