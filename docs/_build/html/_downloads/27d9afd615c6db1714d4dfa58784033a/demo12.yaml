# The twelfth YAML configuration file in our tutorial about using Galsim config files.

#
# This script introduces wavelength-dependent profiles. Three kinds of chromatic profiles are
# demonstrated here:
#
# 1) A chromatic object representing a DeVaucouleurs galaxy with an early-type SED at redshift 0.8.
#    This galaxy is drawn using the six LSST filters, which demonstrate that the galaxy is a
#    g-band dropout.
#
# 2) A two-component bulge + disk galaxy, in which the bulge and disk have different SEDs.
#
# 3) A wavelength-dependent atmospheric PSF, which includes the effect of differential chromatic
#    refraction and the wavelength dependence of Kolmogorov-turbulence-induced seeing.  This PSF
#    is convolved with a simple Exponential galaxy.
#
# In all three cases, six images are created, which correspond to each of the LSST filters:
# u, g, r, i, z, and y.
#
# After running this script, you can use the following ds9 commands to view the outputs
# in various ways:
#
# 1) ds9 output_yaml/demo12a_*.fits -match scale -zoom 2 -match frame image
# 2) ds9 -rgb -blue -scale limits -0.2 0.8 output_yaml/demo12b_r.fits
#             -green -scale limits -0.25 1.0 output_yaml/demo12b_i.fits
#             -red -scale limits -0.25 1.0 output_yaml/demo12b_z.fits -zoom 2
# 3) ds9 output_yaml/demo12c_*.fits -match scale -zoom 2 -match frame image -blink
#
# New features introduced in this demo:
#
# - sed : file_name, wave_type, flux_type, norm_flux_density, norm_wavelength,
#         norm_flux, norm_bandpass
# - bandpass : filename, wave_type, thin
# - gal : redshift
# - psf_type : ChromaticAtmosphere (base_profile, base_wavelength, latitude, HA)
