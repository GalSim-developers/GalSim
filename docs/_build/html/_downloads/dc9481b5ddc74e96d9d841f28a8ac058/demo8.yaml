# Demo #8
#
# The eighth YAML configuration file in our tutorial about using Galsim config files
# (This file is designed to be viewed in a window 100 characters wide.)
#
# In this script, we show how to run the GalSim config processing using a python dict rather
# than using a config file.  The parallel tutorial examples/demo*.py files have shown how to
# do the same thing as these demo*.yaml files directly in python.  Now we turn the tables
# and show how to use some of the machinery in the GalSim configuration processing
# from within python itself.  As such, this config file doesn't add much in the way
# of new features -- just an option to retry building objects that fail the first time,
# and the ability to build an image using multiple processes.  We intentionally have the
# ellipticity occasionally come out larger than 1, so we redo these objects.
# And we build the same image using a single process and again using 4 processes.
#
# New features introduced in this demo:
#
# - stamp : retry_failures
# - shear type : Eta1Eta2 (eta1, eta2)
# - image : nproc


# We again use the multiple document feature.  So start with the common information:

# Define the PSF profile
psf :
    type : Moffat
    beta : 2.4
    fwhm : 0.65  # arcsec


# Define the galaxy profile
gal :
    type : Sum
    items :
        -   # The disk component
            type : Sersic
            n : 1.5
            # Remember, the flux here is the fractional flux.  The total flux is given
            # below for the sum of the two components.
            flux : { type : Random , min : 0.5 , max : 0.9 }
            half_light_radius : { type : Random , min : 0.5 , max : 1.5 }
            ellip :
                type : E1E2
                e1 : { type : RandomGaussian , sigma : 0.4 }
                e2 : { type : RandomGaussian , sigma : 0.4 }
                # These will sometimes have |e| > 1.
                # In the past, we've dealt with this by truncating the distribution with
                # min/max.  This time, we let the values generated exceed 1, which internally
                # will fail the stamp generation process.  We set retry_failures = 2 below to
                # indicate that the object generation stage should just try again (up to 2
                # times) whenever a failure is encountered.

        -   # The bulge component
            type : Sersic
            n : 3.6
            # Special: if the last item in a Sum doesn't have a flux specified,
            # then it is given whatever is needed to bring the total to 1.
            # This is especially useful when other components have a random value.
            half_light_radius : { type : Random , min : 0.3 , max : 0.9 }
            ellip :
                # An alternative to the above solution for |e| > 1 is to use conformal shear,
                # usually designated as eta.  The eta definition of shear is |eta| = ln(a/b),
                # where a and b are (as usual) the semi-major and semi-minor axes.
                # This definition has the advantage that it is well defined for all values from
                # 0 to infinity, so we don't need to worry about getting |e| > 1.
