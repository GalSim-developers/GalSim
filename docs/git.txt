--- Quick reference for working with git ---

The internet is full of resources on doing various things with git, but we've included a brief
synopsis of the most important commands here.

Much of this has been lifted from Mario Juric's excellent LSST git tutorial, which can be found in
full here:

http://lsstdev.ncsa.uiuc.edu/trac/wiki/GitDemoAndTutorial

Before you start, you'll probably want to put the following in ~/.gitconfig:

[user]
      name = Your Name
      email = user@domain
[push]
      default = upstream

The "push" section changes the default behavior of "git push" to operate on the current branch only,
which makes it symmetric with "git pull", and will help you avoid confusing (but ultimately
harmless) error messages about failing to push refs due to non-fast-forward merges on branches other
than the current one.

--- Basic workflow ---

# 0. clone the repo (only need to do this once, of course)
git clone git@github.com:GalSim-developers/GalSim.git

# 1. check which branch you are on, mostly like you want to be on the master branch
git branch

# 2. create new branch for issue X, both locally and remotely
git checkout -b #X
git push -u origin #X

# 3. do work, commit often, push periodically
... do work ...
git commit -a
git push

# 4. when the issue work is complete, merge it master note that merge will commit automatically if
# there are no conflicts
git checkout master
git merge #X      
... fix any merge conflicts ...
... run unit tests, make sure things still work ...
git push

--- Initial configuration ---

# Configure your name; this will appear in commits
git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"

# Configure you e-mail; this will appear in commits
git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"

# Use colors if terminal is capable
git config --global color.ui true

# Make 'git push' push only the current branch, and not all of them (probably won't matter, but
# git's default behavior is confusing)
git config --global push.default tracking

--- Add a new file ---

echo '# New build system!' > CMakeList.txt
git status            # See the status of files in the working directory
git status -s         # The same in format familiar to SVN users
git add CMakeList.txt       # Add a new file to be tracked by git
git status
git commit				 # Commit the changes (the file addition)
git log

--- Editing a file ---

echo '#more stuff' >> CMakeList.txt   # Change the file
git status                            # See that the file is now "dirty"
git diff                              # See the changes
git commit -a               # Commit all changes (don't forget the -a!)

# You can also use "git add" and "git commit" separately, to only commit some of the files you've
# made changes to.  This is called the "staging area", and it makes it easier to make your commits
# more atomic and meaningful, which makes it easer to use the logs and fix merge conflicts.

--- Branches ---

git branch        # Show the branch we're on
git branch -a     # List all the branches

git checkout -b mybranch   # make a new branch and check it out
git checkout mybranch      # checkout an existing branch

# checking out a branch that wasn't created locally
git fetch         # sync with remote repositories (pull does this too)
git checkout -t origin/otherbranch  # make a "tracking branch" and check it out

# With recent versions of git, you can also just say "git checkout otherbranch" as an equivalent of
# the last line (it won't work at all for earlier versions, so it's safe to try).

--- About Tracking and Remote Branches ---

When you do a "git fetch", git gets all the changes in the repository you cloned from.  That repo is
called "origin", and it's what git calls a "remote".  You can have multiple remotes if you like, or
change their names (see "git remote --help"), but most of the time you'll just deal with origin.
Anyhow, when you fetch, the branches in the remote repository are synced into local branches with
names like "origin/master" and "origin/someotherbranch".  These are "remote branches", and you
should never check them out directly.

Instead, you make a local branch that "tracks" the remote branch, with
"git push -u <remote>" (if you made the branch) or
"git checkout -t <remote>/<branch>" (if someone else did), as above.
A tracking branch tells git where to push your changes when you say "git push", and where to pull
from when you say "git pull".  In fact, "git pull" is basically equivalent to doing "git fetch"
(which puts remote changes into the remote branches) and "git merge <remote>" (which merges the
remote branch into the tracking branch).

--- About the impact of how we chose branch names ---

We chose our branch names such that they will start with #.  This has an impact if we have local
tracking branches that we want to delete.  Say, for example, that we want to make a tracking branch
for #12.  As above, this can be done using

git checkout -t origin/#12

When we use "branch" to check what branches we have, we will have a #12 on the list.  But let's say
branch #12 gets merged to master and we no longer want the tracking branch sitting around.  If we do

git branch -d #12

then nothing will happen because either git or the shell is trying to interpret the #.  We have to
say

git branch -d "#12"

to get the tracking branch to go away.

--- Tags ---

We will be creating tags corresponding to all completed milestones and code releases.  By default,
these should be annotated tags (which include more information).  These tags are created using

git tag -a TAGNAME -m MESSAGE

and are pushed to the repository using

git push --tags

To use a code version corresponding to some tag, you can use

git checkout TAGNAME

To list all tags, use

git tags

and to get information about some particular tag, use

git show TAGNAME

NOTE: when you go to the code version corresponding to some tag, you may get a message warning you
that you have a detached HEAD.  This is okay; it means that git doesn't know what to do if you make
a commit (i.e., you're not on any branch).  But, by definition, we should not be changing tagged
versions; we should be working on specific branches, so this warning is not a problem.

--- Deleting branches on the origin ---

PLEASE NOTE: We have not decided any policy about cleaning up old branches on the origin yet, so
please do not use this for deleting branches that have been successfully merged into the master
branch.  Use it only for cleanup jobs, as in Issue #122.

The rather obtuse syntax for deleting a branch on the origin uses a push command as follows:

git push origin :"branchname"

or for a direct example:

git push origin :"#36_Image_unit_tests"

using the case in Issue #122 of wishing to remove a branch named #36_Image_unit_tests from the 
origin.  

Note in that in Issue #122 this usage led to the removal of the branch name for the commits
associated with the work done in #36_Image_unit_tests, highlighting why Barney made a mistake in
creating a new branch for an old Issue that already had one.

--- What happens if you make a huge mess while working locally? ---

If you have made a mess with some local commits (for example, committed something to the wrong
branch), then there are ways to fix it.  For example:

git reset --hard <commit> allows you to set a branch to any commit, and <commit> can be a lot of
different things. For instance, if you want to set your version of master to whatever the remote one
is, do git reset --hard origin/master while on your master. If you want to totally remove the last
two commits, you can do git reset --hard HEAD~2.

git commit --amend is another neat trick that lets you modify the last commit, and you can edit
history even further back with git rebase -i.

Again, this should only be done if you haven't pushed the changes.
