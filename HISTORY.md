v0.4
====

- Added ability to pad images for InterpolatedImage or RealGalaxy with either
  correlated or uncorrelated noise. (#238)
- Added python-level LookupTable class which wraps the existing C++ Table
  class. (#305)
- Lensing engine updates: (#305)
  - Added the option of drawing shears from a tabulated P(k)
  - Added ability to handle conversions between different angular units.
  - Fixed an important bug in the normalization of the generated shears.
- Added a DistDeviate class. (#306)
- Added galsim.correlatednoise.get_COSMOS_CorrFunc(...). (#345)
- Added im.addNoiseSNR(). (#349)
- Made a new Noise hierarchy for CCDNoise (no longer a BaseDeviate),
  GaussianNoise, PoissonNoise, DeviateNoise. (#349)


v0.3
====

- Fixed several bugs in the Sersic class that had been causing ringing.
  (#319, #330)
- Added support for reading and writing compressed fits files. (#299)
- Added InterpolatedImage class to wrap existing C++ level SBInterpolatedImage.
  (#333)
- Added a new class structure for representing 2D correlation functions, used
  to describe correlated noise in images. (#297).
- Add FormattedStr option for string values in config files. (#315)
- Added obj.drawK() to the python layer. (#319)
- Fixed several sources of memory leaks. (#327)
- Updated the moments and PSF correction code to use the Image class and TMV;
  to handle weight and bad pixel maps for the input Images; and to run ~2-3
  times faster. (#331, #332)
- Fixed bug in config RandomCircle when using inner_radius option.


v0.2
====

- Significant revamping and commenting of demos, including both python and
  config versions (#243, #285, #289).
- Added python-level int1d function to wrap C++-level integrator, which
  allowed us to remove our dependency on scipy. (#288)
- Significant expansion in config functionality, using YAML/JSON format
  config files (#291, #295).
- Fixed some bugs in Image handling (including bugs related to duplicate
  numpy.int32 types), and made Image handling generally more robust (#293, #294).
- Fixed bug in wrapping of angles (now not automatic -- use wrap() explicitly).


v0.1
====

Initial version of GalSim with most of the basic functionality.
