# Demo #9
#
# The ninth YAML configuration file in our tutorial about using Galsim config files
# (This file is designed to be viewed in a window 100 characters wide.)
#
# This script simulates cluster lensing or galaxy-galaxy lensing.  The gravitational shear
# applied to each galaxy is calculated for an NFW halo mass profile.  We simulate observations 
# of galaxies around 20 different clusters -- 5 each of 4 different masses.  Each cluster
# has its own file, organized into 4 directories (one for each mass).  For each cluster, we
# draw 20 lensed galaxies at random positions on the image.
#
# New features introduced in this demo:
#
# - shear_type : NFWHaloShear (redshift)
# - float_type : NFWHaloMag (redshift)
# - input : nfw_halo (mass, conc, redshift)
# - shear_type : Eta1Eta2 (eta1, eta2)
# - image type : Scattered (size, nobjects)
# - str_value type : NumberedFile (root, num, ext, digits)
# - output : nproc
# - output : weight
# - output : badpix


# We again use the multiple document feature.  So start with the common information:

# Define the PSF profile
psf : 
    type : Kolmogorov
    fwhm : 0.5  # arcsec


# Define the galaxy profile
gal :
    type : Exponential
    half_light_radius : { type : Random , min : 0.4 , max : 1.2 }
    flux : { type : Random , min : 1.0e4 , max : 1.0e6 }
    ellip :
        # The eta definition of shear is |eta| = ln(a/b) where a and b are (as usual)
        # the semi-major and semi-minor axes.  This definition has the advantage that 
        # it is well defined for all values from 0 to infinity, so we don't need to
        # cut it off to avoid |e| > 1.
        type : Eta1Eta2
        eta1 : { type : RandomGaussian , sigma : 0.4 }
        eta2 : { type : RandomGaussian , sigma : 0.4 }

    magnification :
        # For this demo, we use a model of on NFW halo for our magnification and shear.
        # Both require that the galaxy to have a redshift attribute.
        # We put the redshift at the gal level, rather than here, since we want to use the 
        # same value for both mag and shear.
        # They also require an input.nfw_halo field.  See below.
        type : NFWHaloMag

    shear:
        type : NFWHaloShear

    # Note: the redshift could be variable for each galaxy.  We just use a constant here.
    redshift : 0.6 


# Setup the NFW Halo:
# This isn't really an "input" in the normal sense, but we put in input anything that
# requires an initial setup.  That includes setting up the NFW Halo parameters.
input :
    nfw_halo : 
        # Note: the input field gets processed each time we start a new output file
        # So any non-constant variables here will change with that cadence.
        # For our mass, we use each value for 5 sequential files, then change
        # to the next mass in the list.
        mass : 
            type : List
            items : [ 1.0e15, 7.0e14, 4.0e14, 2.0e14 ]
            index : 
                type : Sequence
                first : 0
                repeat : &n_clusters_per_mass 5
                # Note: this is a good example of when the YAML named variables come in handy.
                # We'll use this variable below when setting up the output files.

        conc : 4  # The concentration parameter = virial radius / NFW scale radius
        redshift : 0.3  # The redshift of the halo.

        # These next two are optional.  If they are omitted, then (0.3, 0.7) are actually the 
        # defaults.  If you only specify one of them, the other is set so that the total is 1.
        # But you can define both values so that the total is not 1 if you want.
        # Radiation is assumed to be zero and dark energy equation of state w = -1.
        omega_m : 0.3
        omega_lam : 0.7

        # Another optional parameter for nfw_halo is pos, which specifies the location of 
        # the halo with respect to the center of the image.  The default is (0,0).
        # pos : 0,0



# Define some other information about the images 
image :

    # A Scattered image means that the objects can be placed arbitrarily at any (x,y) value.
    type : Scattered

    # Either size or (xsize,ysize) is required to specify the size of the image.
    size : 512  # pixels

    # nobjects is required to specify how many objects to place on the image.
    nobjects : 20

    # You can optionally specify stamp_size or (stamp_xsize,stamp_ysize) to set the size of
    # the postage stamp image to draw for each object.  However, if you omit these,
    # then galsim will automatically determine a good size to draw each object -- larger
    # for larger objects, and smaller for smaller ones.  So this is usually the way to go.
    
    # Another optional parameter is center (which expects a "pos_value") to specify the location
    # of the center of each object.  The default if this is omitted is random x from 
    # 1..xsize and random y from 1..ysize.  i.e.
    # center : 
    #     type : XY 
    #     x : { type : Random , min : 1 , max : xsize }
    #     y : { type : Random , min : 1 , max : ysize }


    pixel_scale : 0.19  # arcsec / pixel

    noise :
        sky_level : 1.0e6  # ADU / arcsec^2

    random_seed : 8383721


# Define the names and format of the output files
output :

    nfiles : 20

    file_name :

        # A NumberedFile type creates a string of the form rootNNNNext
        # where the NNNN is a number that will typically be drawn from a Sequence.
        # In our case, our file_name's will be:
        #     cluster0001.fits
        #     cluster0002.fits
        #     cluster0003.fits

        #     cluster0005.fits
        type : NumberedFile

        # root specifies the text to go before the number
        root : 'cluster'

        # num specifies how to choose the number for each file. 
        # If omitted, the default is simply a Sequence starting at 1.
        # i.e. { type : Sequence , first : 1 }
        num : 
            type : Sequence
            first : 1
            # Here is a case where using a named variable comes in handy.

            last : *n_clusters_per_mass

        # ext specifies the text to go after the number, if desired (default = None)
        ext : '.fits'

        # digits specifies how many digits to use in writing the number.  The default is
        # to use as many as necessary, but if your numbers go above 9, then this makes
        # the file names appear out of order in a directory listing.  So it is common 
        # practice to pad the smaller numbers with 0's so file0099 will appear before file0100.
        digits : 4


    dir : 
        # Our directory names wil be:
        #     nfw1
        #     nfw2
        #     nfw3
        #     nfw4

            repeat : *n_clusters_per_mass

    # The weight field means that a weight image should be built and written out.
    # The weights are calculated as the inverse variance in each pixel.
    weight :
        # Either file_name or hdu is required for weight.  In this case we write to the 
        # first hdu extension.  The main image is in the primary HDU, which is number 0.
        # Note: it is an error to skip hdu's, so if weight is the only other image, it must 
        # be in hud 1.  If weight, badpix and psf all specify an hdu value, then they must be
        # 1, 2 and 3 in some order.
        # Also, hdu is only valid for image.type = Fits (which is the default if unspecified).
        hdu : 2

    # It is common for astrometric images to also have a bad pixel mask.  We don't have any
    # defect simulation currently, so our bad pixel masks are currently all zeros. 
    # But someday, we plan to add defect functionality to GalSim, at which point, we'll
    # be able to mark those defects on a bad pixel mask.
    badpix :
        hdu : 1

    # nproc in the output field indicates that multiple processes should be used to 
    # build the files.  This is a much more efficient way to parallelize than putting
    # nproc in the image field (as in demo8.yaml), since it requires less communication 
    # between the processes.  Unless you are building enormous files such that only one
    # at a time can fit in memory, this will be the normal way you'll want to parallelize.
    #
    # Also, this time, we set nproc <= 0.  This means that galsim should try to automatically
    # determine the number of cpus you have and use that many processes.
    nproc : -1
