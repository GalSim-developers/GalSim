# Demo #9
#
# The ninth YAML configuration file in our tutorial about using Galsim config files
# (This file is designed to be viewed in a window 100 characters wide.)
#
# This script simulates cluster lensing or galaxy-galaxy lensing.  The gravitational shear
# applied to each galaxy is calculated for an NFW halo mass profile.  We simulate observations
# of galaxies around 20 different clusters -- 5 each of 4 different masses.  Each cluster
# has its own file, organized into 4 directories (one for each mass).  For each cluster, we
# draw 20 lensed galaxies located at random positions in the image.  The PSF is appropriate for a
# space-like simulation.  (Some of the numbers used are the values for HST.)  And we apply
# a cubic telescope distortion for the WCS.  Finally, we also output a truth catalog for each
# +output image that could be used for testing the accuracy of shape or flux measurements.
#

# Define the PSF profile
psf :
    # We use OpticalPSF with a few new features we haven't mentioned before:
    # 1) We separately specify the light wavelength and telescope diameter, relying on OpticalPSF to
    #    convert to appropriate units (arcsec by default, though the routine can be told otherwise).
    # 2) We introduce the parameters trefoil1 and trefoil2, which are 3rd order Zernike terms.
    # 3) We specify support struts that hold the secondary mirror.  You can specify how
    #    many struts to have, their thickness relative to the diameter, and the angle of the
    #    first one relative to the vertical axis.  Here, we use 4 supports.

    # It represents a typical 3D galaxy disk profile inclined at an arbitrary angle relative
    # to face on.

    type : Scattered

    # Either size or (xsize,ysize) is required to specify the size of the image.
    size : 512  # pixels

    # nobjects is required to specify how many objects to place on the image.
    # It could just be a number (say, 20), but in this case, we let the number
    # of sources be different for each cluster.
    nobjects :
        type : Random
        min : 15
        max : 30

    # You can optionally specify stamp_size or (stamp_xsize,stamp_ysize) to set the size of
    # the postage stamp image to draw for each object.  However, if you omit these,
    # then GalSim will automatically determine a good size to draw each object -- larger
    # for larger objects, and smaller for smaller ones.  So this is usually the way to go.


    # There are four ways to specify the location of each postage stamp on the full image for
    # the Scattered image type. You may specify:
    #
    #   image_pos = the position in pixels on the full image
    #   world_pos = (a) the position in arcsec (or whatever sky units you are using) relative
    #                   to the center of the image
    #               (b) the celestial coordinates on the sky (i.e. RA, Dec).  This option requires
    #                   that the WCS of the image be a CelestialWCS (cf. demo11)
    #   (neither) = let the objects be placed randomly anywhere on the image
    #
    # The difference between these and gal.shift is that gal.shift moves the object with
    # respect to the center of the postage stamp, while these set the position of the
    # postage stamp on the larger full image.
    #
    # In this case we use world_pos to place each object in sky coordinates relative to
    # the center of the image (option a for world_pos above).  We use RandomCircle with an inner
    # radius to avoid placing galaxies too close to the halo center where the lensing is not weak.
    # The outer radius is 21 arcsec, which is large enough to cover all the way to the corners,
    # although it means occasionally an object will be skipped because its postage stamp falls
    # completely off the edge of the image.
    world_pos :
        type : RandomCircle
        radius : 21       # arcsec
        inner_radius : 3  # arcsec

    # Note: the default option if we didn't specify either image_pos or world_pos (described as
    # neither above) would be equivalent to the following:
    #
    # image_pos :
    #     type : XY
    #     x : { type : Random , min : 1 , max : xsize }
    #     y : { type : Random , min : 1 , max : ysize }
    #
    # where xsize and ysize are whatever values are used for the size of the image.  In this case,
    # both are equal to 512, set by the image.size parameter above.


    # For the WCS, this time we use UVFunction, which lets you define arbitrary u(x,y)
    # and v(x,y) functions.  We use a simple cubic radial function to create a
    # pincushion distortion.  This is a typical kind of telescope distortion, although
    # we exaggerate the magnitude of the effect to make it more apparent.
    # The pixel size in the center of the image is 0.05, but near the corners (r=362),
    # the pixel size is approximately 0.075, which is much more distortion than is
    # normally present in typical telescopes.  But it makes the effect of the variable
    # pixel area obvious when you look at the weight image in the output files.

            # - image_num is the running image number, starting at 0

    # the full machine memory and noclobber = True to only do the files that failed in the
