Demo #10

The tenth script in our tutorial about using GalSim in python scripts: examples/demo*.py.
(This file is designed to be viewed in a window 100 characters wide.)

This script uses both a variable PSF and variable shear, taken from a power spectrum, along
the lines of a Great10 (Kitching, et al, 2012) image.  The galaxies are placed on a grid
(10 x 10 in this case, rather than 100 x 100 in the interest of time.)  Each postage stamp
is 48 x 48 pixels.  Instead of putting the PSF images on a separate image, we package them
as the second HDU in the file.  For the galaxies, we use a random selection from 5 specific
RealGalaxy objects, selected to be 5 particularly irregular ones. (These are taken from 
the same catalog of 100 objects that demo6 used.)  The galaxies are oriented in a ring 
test (Nakajima & Bernstein 2007) of 20 each.

New features introduced in this demo:

- rng = galsim.BaseDeviate(seed)
- obj = galsim.RealGalaxy(real_galaxy_catalog, id)
- obj = galsim.Convolve([list], real_space)
- ps = galsim.PowerSpectrum(e_power_function, b_power_function)
- g1,g2 = ps.getShear(grid_spacing, grid_nx, rng)
- g1,g2 = ps.getShear(pos)
- galsim.random.permute(rng, list1, list2, ...)

- Choosing PSF parameters as a function of (x,y)
- Selecting RealGalaxy by ID rather than index.
- Putting the PSF image in a second HDU in the same file as the main image.
- Using PowerSpectrum for the applied shear.
- Doing a full ring test (i.e. not just 90 degree rotated pairs)

    Make images using variable PSF and shear:
      - The main image is 10 x 10 postage stamps.
      - Each postage stamp is 48 x 48 pixels.
      - The second HDU has the corresponding PSF image.
      - Applied shear is from a power spectrum P(k) ~ k^1.8.
      - Galaxies are real galaxies oriented in a ring test of 20 each.
      - The PSF is Gaussian with FWHM, ellipticity and position angle functions of (x,y)
      - Noise is Poisson using a nominal sky value of 1.e6.
