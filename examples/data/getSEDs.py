"""@file getSEDs.py
Grab example SEDs from the web, clip them at 22050 Angstroms, and then thin with rel_err = 1.e-5.
Note that the outputs of this script, which are the files GALSIM_DIR/examples/data/CWW_*.sed, are
already included in the repository.  This script just lets users know where these files came from
and how they were altered.
