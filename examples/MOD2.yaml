# YAML configuration file for use with the executable galsim_yaml
# Type:
#   galsim_yaml MOD2.yaml
#
# This configuration file is designed to be equivalent to the example script called
# Script2 in MultiObjectDemo.py
#
#    Make images similar to that done for the Great08 challenge:
#      - Each fits file is 10 x 10 postage stamps.
#        (The real Great08 images are 100x100, but in the interest of making the Demo
#         script a bit quicker, we only build 100 stars and 100 galaxies.)
#      - Each postage stamp is 40 x 40 pixels.
#      - One image is all stars.
#      - A second image is all galaxies.
#      - Applied shear is the same for each galaxy.
#      - Galaxies are oriented randomly, but in pairs to cancel shape noise.
#      - Noise is poisson using a nominal sky value of 1.e6.
#      - Galaxies are sersic profiles.
