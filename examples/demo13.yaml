# Demo #13
#
# The thirteenth YAML configuration file in our tutorial about using Galsim config files.
# (This file is designed to be viewed in a window 100 characters wide.)
#
# This script is intended to produce a relatively realistic scene of galaxies and stars as will
# be observed by the Roman Space Telescope, including the Roman PSF, WCS, and various NIR detector
# effects.
#
# It introduces several non-idealities arising from NIR detectors, in particular those that will
# be observed and accounted for in the Roman Space Telescope.  In the python layer, these are
# implemented directly using various functions and values in the galsim.roman sub-module.
#
# In the config file, these are all automatically incorporated by using a special image type
# called RomanSCA.  There are options to turn off any of the Roman detector effects, but the
# default behavior is to include all effects that are currently known about:
#
# - Estimated sky background, including an estimate of the scattered light level.
# - Estimated thermal backgrounds
# - Reciprocity failure (aka Count-rate nonlinearity)
# - Dark current
# - Classical nonlinearity
# - Inter-pixel capacitance (IPC)
# - Read noise
#
# Persistence is not currently implemented, but is planned to be included in a future update.
# It is currently implemented in the python layer, but it is not currently clear how best to
# incorporate it into the config layer.
#
# This example also uses chromatic photon shooting, which is generally a more efficient way to
# simulate scenes with many faint galaxies.  The default FFT method for drawing chromatically is
# fairly slow, since it needs to integrate the image over the bandpass.  With photon shooting, the
# photons are assigned wavelengths according to the SED of the galaxy, and then each photon has
# the appropriate application of the chromatic PSF according to the wavelength.
#
# This demo will by default produce 3 output images, one for each of the filters:
#     Y106, J129, H158
# and only a single SCA (7).
#
# Options for changing this to simulate more or different filters and/or SCAs are given below.
#

# New features introduced in this demo:
#
# - Top-level field modules
# - obj type: RomanPSF
# - image type: RomanSCA
# - draw_method=phot in conjunction with chromatic objects
# - Multiple random seeds (particular so one can repeat the same values for multiple images)
# - rng_num specification in various fields
# - Multiple inputs of the same type.  Use num to specify which item in the list to use each time.

modules:

    # Including galsim.roman in the list of modules to import will add a number of Roman-specific
    # functions and classes that we will use here.
    - galsim.roman

    # We need this for one of our Eval items.  GalSim does not by default import datetime into
    # the globals dict it uses when evaluating Eval items, so we can tell it to import it here.
    - datetime

    # You can define your own object types, stamp types, image types, value types, etc.
    #
    # There are instructions about how to do so in the documentation:
    #   http://galsim-developers.github.io/GalSim/_build/html/config.html
    #
    # If a local file has the appropriate Register commands, then importing it will enable
    # whatever extra types you have defined.  Here we use two user-defined types:
    #
    # - A stamp type, MixedScene, defined in the file mixed_scene.py.
    # - A value type, LogNormal, defined in the file log_normal.py.
    #
    # Note: Both of these types are also available in the python repository called galsim_extra.
    #       cf. https://github.com/esheldon/galsim_extra
    #       So if that is installed, you could instead put galsim_extra in the modules list
    #       and both of these (as well as numerous other user-defined types) would be available.
    - mixed_scene
    - log_normal

# Define some other information about the images
image:

    # A special Image type that knows all the Roman SCA geometry, WCS, gain, etc.
    # It also by default applies a number of detector effects, but these can be turned
    # off if desired by setting some parameters (given below) to False.
    type: RomanSCA

    # When you want to have multiple images generate the same random galaxies, then
    # you can set up multiple random number generators with different update cadences
    # by making random_seed a list.
    # The default behavior is just to have the random seeds for each object go in order by
    # object number across all images, but this shows how to set it up so we use two separate
    # cadences.
    # The first one behaves normally, which will be used for things like noise on the image.
    # The second one sets the initial seed for each object to repeat to the same starting value
    # at the start of each filter.  If we were doing more than 3 total files, it would then
    # move on to another sequence for the next 3 and so on.
    random_seed:
        # Used for noise and nobjects.
        - 12345

        # Used for objects.  Repeats sequence for each filter
        # Note: Don't use $ shorthand here, since that will implicitly be evaluated once and then
        # treated the same way as an integer (i.e. making a regular sequence starting from that
        # value).  Using an explicit dict with an Eval type means GalSim will leave it alone and
        # evaluate it as is for each object.
        -
          type: Eval
          str: '12345

    # We're just doing one SCA here.
    # If you wanted to do all of them in each of three filters (given below), you could use:
    #
    # SCA:
    #     type: Sequence
    #     first: 1
    #     last: 18
    #     repeat: 3  # repeat each SCA num 3 times before moving on, for the 3 filters.
    #
    SCA: 7

    filter:
        type: List
        items: ['Y106', 'J129', 'H158']

        # location to a directory in your home directory.  (Feel free to use any other convenient
        # directory of course, depending on your situation.)  You still need to rerun this command
        # after reinstalls of GalSim, but it will just need to update the link, not actually
        # re-download anything.
