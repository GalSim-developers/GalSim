# Demo #2
#
# The second YAML configuration file in our tutorial about using Galsim config files
# (This file is designed to be viewed in a window 100 characters wide.)
#
# This script is a bit more sophisticated, but still pretty basic.  We're still only making
# a single image, but now the galaxy has an exponential radial profile and is sheared.
# The PSF is a circular Moffat profile.  The noise is drawn from a Poisson distribution
# using the flux from both the object and a background sky level to determine the
# variance in each pixel.
#
# New features introduced in this demo:
#
# - obj type : Exponential (flux, scale_radius)
# - obj type : Moffat (flux, beta, half_light_radius)
# - obj : shear
# - shear type : G1G2 (g1, g2)
# - noise type : Poisson (sky_level)
# - image : random_seed


# Define the galaxy profile
gal :
    # Exponential requires one of scale_radius, fwhm, or half_light_radius.
    type : Exponential
    scale_radius : 2.7  # arcsec
    flux : 1.e5         # counts

    shear :
        # Shear the galaxy by some value.
        # There are several ways to specify shears, so we need to start by defining a type
        # again.  (This is a theme in our configuration grammar.)
        # G1G2 means to use the so-called "reduced shear" definition, commonly
        # written as (g1,g2).
        type : G1G2
        g1 : 0.1
        g2 : 0.2


# Define the PSF profile
psf :
    # A Moffat is a better approximation of ground-based PSFs than a Gaussian.
    # F(r) = (1+(r/rd)^2)^(-beta)
    # It requires the beta parameter to be specified.
    # It also requires one of scale_radius, fwhm, or half_light_radius.
    type : Moffat
    beta : 5.0
    half_light_radius : 1.0  # arcsec


# Define some other information about the images
image :
    pixel_scale : 0.2  # arcsec / pixel

    noise :
        # Poisson noise models how noise normally happens on CCD images -- each pixel
        # has Poisson noise according to the number of photons hitting it.
        type : Poisson
        # Most of the noise in the image is normally from the sky flux, rather than each
        # object's flux, so you need to specify what the sky level should be.
        # Note: the final image will be "sky subtracted", so the mean background level
        # will be 0.  This just specifies the sky level to use for the noise.
        sky_level : 2.5e3  # counts / arcsec^2

    # If you want the random values to be deterministic, you can provide an initial seed.
    # If this isn't set, then it will use the current time to create an initial seed.
    # This is the same seed that is used in demo2.py, which means the images produced
    # by the two methods will be precisely identical.
    random_seed : 1534225


# Define the name and format of the output file
output :
    dir : output_yaml
    file_name : demo2.fits
