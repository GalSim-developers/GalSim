Demo #5

The fifth script in our tutorial about using GalSim in python scripts: examples/demo*.py.
(This file is designed to be viewed in a window 100 characters wide.)

This script is intended to mimic a Great08 (Bridle, et al, 2010) LowNoise image.
We produce a single image made up of tiles of postage stamps for each individual object.  
(We only do 10 x 10 postage stamps rather than 100 x 100 as they did in the interest of time.)  
Each postage stamp is 40 x 40 pixels.  One image is all stars.  A second image is all galaxies.
The stars are truncated Moffat profiles.  The galaxies are Exponential profiles.
(Great08 mixed pure bulge and pure disk for its LowNoise run.  We're just doing disks to 
make things simpler.)  The galaxies are oriented randomly, but in 90 degree-rotated pairs to 
cancel the effect of shape noise.  The applied shear is the same for each galaxy.  

New features introduced in this demo:

- ud = galsim.UniformDeviate(seed)
- gd = galsim.GaussianDeviate(ud, sigma)
- ccdnoise = galsim.CCDNoise(ud)
- image *= scalar
- bounds = galsim.BoundsI(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
- pos = bounds.center()
- pos.x, pos.y
- sub_image = image[bounds]
- obj2 = obj.createSheared(e, beta)

- Build a single large image, and access sub-images within it.
- Set the galaxy size based on the PSF size and a resolution factor.
- Set the object's flux according to a target S/N value.
- Use 90 degree-rotated pairs for the intrinsic galaxy shapes.
- Shift by a random (dx, dy) drawn from a unit circle top hat.

    Make images similar to that done for the Great08 challenge:
      - Each fits file is 10 x 10 postage stamps.
        (The real Great08 images are 100x100, but in the interest of making the Demo
         script a bit quicker, we only build 100 stars and 100 galaxies.)
      - Each postage stamp is 40 x 40 pixels.
      - One image is all stars.
      - A second image is all galaxies.
      - Applied shear is the same for each galaxy.
      - Galaxies are oriented randomly, but in pairs to cancel shape noise.
      - Noise is Poisson using a nominal sky value of 1.e6.
      - Galaxies are Exponential profiles.
