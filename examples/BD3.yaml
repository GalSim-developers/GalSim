# YAML configuration file for use with the executable galsim_yaml
# Type:
#   galsim_yaml BD3.yaml
#
# This configuration file is designed to be equivalent to the example script called
# Script3 in BasicDemo.py.
# This is getting reasonably close to including all the principle features of a 
# ground-based telescope:
# - Use a sheared, Sersic profile for the galaxy 
#   (n = 3.5, half_light_radius=3.7).
# - Let the PSF have both atmospheric and optical components.
#     - The atmospheric component is the sum of two non-circular Gaussians.
#     - The optical component has some defocus, coma, and astigmatism.
# - Add both Poisson noise to the image and Gaussian read noise.
# - Let the pixels be slightly distorted relative to the sky.
#
