Demo #7

The seventh script in our tutorial about using GalSim in python scripts: examples/demo*.py.
(This file is designed to be viewed in a window 100 characters wide.)

This script introduces drawing profiles with photon shooting rather than doing the 
convolution with an FFT.  It makes images using 5 different kinds of PSF and 5 different
kinds of galaxy.  Some of the parameters (flux, size and shape) are random variables, so 
each of the 25 pairings is drawn 4 times with different realizations of the random numbers.
The profiles are drawn twice: once with the FFT method, and once with photon shooting.
The two images are drawn side by side so it is easy to visually compare the results.
The 100 total profiles are written to a FITS data cube, which makes it easy to scroll
through the images comparing the two drawing methods.


New features introduced in this demo:

- obj = galsim.Airy(lam_over_diam)
- obj2 = obj.copy()
- obj.applyDilation(scale)
- image.setScale(pixel_scale)
- obj.draw(image)  -- i.e. taking the scale from the image rather than a dx= argument
- obj.drawShoot(image, max_extra_noise, rng)
- noise = galsim.PoissonDeviate(rng, mean)
- writeCube(..., compress='gzip')

    Make a fits image cube where each frame has two images of the same galaxy drawn

    We do this for 5 different PSFs and 5 different galaxies, each with 4 different (random)
