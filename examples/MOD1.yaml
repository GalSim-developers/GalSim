# YAML configuration file for use with the executable galsim_yaml
# Type:
#   galsim_yaml MOD1.yaml
#
# This configuration file is designed to be equivalent to the example script called
# Script1 in MultiObjectDemo.py
#
#    Make a fits image cube using parameters from an input catalog
#      - The number of images in the cube matches the number of rows in the catalog.
#      - Each image size is computed automatically by GalSim based on the Nyquist size.
#      - Only galaxies.  No stars.
#      - PSF is Moffat
#      - Each galaxy is bulge plus disk: deVaucouleurs + Exponential.
#      - Parameters taken from the input catalog:
#        - PSF beta
#        - PSF fwhm
#        - PSF e1
#        - PSF e2
#        - PSF trunc
#        - Bulge half-light-radius
#        - Bulge e1
#        - Bulge e2
#        - Bulge flux
#        - Disc half-light-radius
#        - Disc e1
#        - Disc e2
#        - Disc flux
#        - Galaxy dx (two components have same center)
#        - Galaxy dy
#      - Applied shear is the same for each file
#      - Noise is poisson using a nominal sky value of 1.e6

# You can define variables to be used later using the & symbol here.
# Later they will be used with the * symbol.
# This can be useful since you can put things you want to change often near the top of the 
# file so you don't have to scroll down to fine the right place to edit something each time 
# you want to change it.
# However, now that we've presented this option, so you can see how it works, we won't 
# bother with it for out subsequent example config files.
