# Demo #5
#
# The fifth YAML configuration file in our tutorial about using Galsim config files
# (This file is designed to be viewed in a window 100 characters wide.)
#
# This script is intended to mimic a Great08 (Bridle, et al, 2010) LowNoise image.
# We produce a single image made up of tiles of postage stamps for each individual object.
# (We only do 10 x 10 postage stamps rather than 100 x 100 as they did in the interest of time.)
# Each postage stamp is 40 x 40 pixels.  One image is all stars.  A second image is all galaxies.
# The stars are truncated Moffat profiles.  The galaxies are Exponential profiles.
# (Great08 mixed pure bulge and pure disk for its LowNoise run.  We're just doing disks to
# make things simpler. However, see demo3 for an example of using bulge+disk galaxies.)
# The galaxies are oriented randomly, but in 90 degree-rotated pairs to cancel the effect of
# shape noise.  The applied shear is the same for each galaxy.
#
# New features introduced in this demo:
#
# - gal : resolution
# - gal : signal_to_noise
# - stamp type : Ring (first, num)
# - value type : RandomGaussian (sigma, min, max)
# - angle type : Random
# - shift type : RandomCircle (radius)
# - image type : Tiled (nx_tiles, ny_tiles, stamp_xsize, stamp_ysize, border)
# - output type : Fits (file_name, dir)
# - output.psf : shift


# Define the PSF profile
psf :
    type : Moffat
    beta : 3
    fwhm : 2.85

    # The Great08 images used a truncated Moffat profile
    trunc : 5.70  # = 2 * FWHM

        type : E1E2

        e2 : -0.007



# For this demo, we have pairs of galaxies that are 90 degree rotations of each other
# to eliminate the effect of shape noise.  (To first order at least.)
# In GalSim, we declare this as a "Ring" stamp type.  We haven't specified the stamp field
# in previous demos.  When it is not given, it defaults to the "Basic" stamp type, which
# simply builds the galaxy and the psf objects as given and convolves them together.
# The ring type does the same thing on the first galaxy, but then for some number of subsequent
# stamps, uses a rotated version of the same galaxy.  After completing the ring, using num
# stamps in total, then a new galaxy is built.
# The ring can have any number of values set around a ring in e1-e2 space.  For 90 degree rotated
# pairs, this corresponds to only 2 values on the "ring" so num = 2 here.
# It is up to the user to make sure the total number of objects in an image is a multiple of num,
# otherwise the last "ring" won't get completed.  In this case 100 is divisible by 2, so it's fine.
stamp :
    type : Ring
    num : 2


    # Any transformations that appear in the stamp field are applied to the galaxy after
    # any rotations due to the ring test.  Here we apply a constant shear to all galaxies.

    # r_gal / r_psf  (use r = half_light_radius)
    # This is in lieu of setting a size parameter directly.
    # Note: The Great08 definition of resolution was based on the observed size,
    #       r_obs ~= sqrt(r_gal^2 + r_psf^2).
    #       So this value approximately corresponds to their resolution = r_obs/r_psf = 1.4.
    resolution : 0.98

    ellip :
        # The first value in each pair has an ellipticity drawn from a
        # Gaussian distribution with rms=0.2.

        # getting too extreme.

    # Here we specify the desired signal-to-noise of the drawn image, rather than
    # a flux value.
    # Our definition of the S/N derives from a weighted integral of the flux:
    # S = sum W(x,y) I(x,y) / sum W(x,y)
    # Where W(x,y) is taken to be a matched filter, so W(x,y) = I(x,y).

# Define some other information about the images
image :

    # The type field defines what kind of image to build.
    # The default is Single, which means one postage stamp per image .

    # on a single image.
