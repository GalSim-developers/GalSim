# Demo #5
#
# The fifth YAML configuration file in our tutorial about using Galsim config files
# (This file is designed to be view in a window 100 characters wide.)
#
# This script is intended to mimic a Great08 challenge LowNoise image.  We produce a single image
# made up of tiles of postage stamps for each individual object.  (We only do 10 x 10 
# postage stamps rather than 100 x 100 as they did in the interest of time.)  Each postage
# stamp is 40 x 40 pixels.  One image is all stars.  A second image is all galaxies.
# The stars are truncated Moffat profiles.  The galaxies are Exponential profiles.
# (Great08 mixed pure bulge and pure disk for its LowNoise run.  We're just doing disks to 
# make things simpler.)  The galaxies are oriented randomly, but in 90 degree-rotated pairs to 
# cancel the effect of shape noise.  The applied shear is the same for each galaxy.  
#
# New features introduced in this demo:
#
# - gal : resolution
# - gal : signal_to_noise
# - shear (or ellip) type : Ring (first, num)
# - value type : RandomGaussian (sigma, min, max)
# - angle type : Random
# - shift type : RandomCircle (radius)
# - image type : Tiled (nx_tiles, ny_tiles, stamp_xsize, stamp_ysize, border)
# - output type : Fits (file_name, dir)


# Define the PSF profile
psf : 
    type : Moffat

    # The Great08 images used a truncated Moffat profile
    trunc : 5.70  # = 2 * FWHM

    # Great08 mixed pure bulge and pure disk for its LowNoise run.

    # r_gal / r_psf  (use r = half_light_radius)
    # This is in lieu of setting a size parameter directly.
    # Note: The Great08 definition of resolution was based on the observed size,
    #       r_obs ~= sqrt(r_gal^2 + r_psf^2).  
    #       So this value approximately corresponds to their resolution = r_obs/r_psf = 1.4.
    resolution : 0.98

    # Here we specify the desired signal-to-noise of the drawn image, rather than 
    # a flux value.  
    # Our definition of the S/N derives from a weighted integral of the flux:
    # S = sum W(x,y) I(x,y) / sum W(x,y)
    # Where W(x,y) is taken to be a matched filter, so W(x,y) = I(x,y).
    signal_to_noise : 200
    
    # For the ellipticity, we have pairs that are 90 degree rotations of each other
    # to elliminate the effect of shape noise.  (To first order at least.)
    # In GalSim, we declare this as a "Ring" test.  The ring can have any number of
    # values set around a ring in e1-e2 space.  For 90 degree rotated pairs, this 
    # corresponds to only 2 values on the "ring".

            # Gaussian distribution with rms=0.2.

    # is applied before the shear.

    # - dilate or dilation        = scale linear size of the object preserving flux
    # - ellip                     = set the intrinsic shape of the object
    # - rotate or rotation        = rotate by some angle
    # - magnify or magnification  = scale linear size of object preserving surface brightness
    # - shear                     = apply the gravitational shear
    # - shift                     = shift the centroid of the object
