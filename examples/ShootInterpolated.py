"""
Simple test of shooting photons to sample from an existing pixelized image.
Usage: ShootInterpolated.py <input FITS> <output FITS> <dx> <dim> <nPhotons> [g1] [g2]
<input FITS> is name of the input FITS image, whose pixel scale will be treated as 1 unit.
<output FITS> is name of FITS file image to be produced by sampling input
dx is pixel scale for output image
dim is number of pixels per side for output image
nPhotons is number of photons to shoot through the image
g1 and g2 are reduced shears to be applied while shooting
"""
