Demo #6

The sixth script in our tutorial about using GalSim in python scripts: examples/demo*.py.
(This file is designed to be viewed in a window 100 characters wide.)

This script uses real galaxy images from COSMOS observations.  The catalog of real galaxy
images distributed with GalSim only includes 100 galaxies, but you can download a much
larger set of images.  See https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim/wiki for a link
to the download page.

The galaxy images include images of the effective PSF for the original observations, 
so GalSim considers the galaxy profile to be the observed image deconvolved by that PSF.
In this case, we then randomly rotate the galaxies, apply a given gravitational shear as
well as gravitational magnification, and then finally convolve by a double Gaussian PSF.
The final image can of course have any pixel scale, not just that of the original images.
The output for this script is to a FITS "data cube".  With DS9, this can be viewed with a
slider to quickly move through the different images.


New features introduced in this demo:

- real_cat = galsim.RealGalaxyCatalog(file_name, image_dir)
- real_cat.preload()
- obj = galsim.Gaussian(fwhm, flux)
- obj = galsim.RealGalaxy(real_cat, index)
- obj.applyRotation(theta)
- obj.applyMagnification(scale)
- image += image2
- galsim.fits.writeCube([list of images], file_name)

    Make a fits image cube using real COSMOS galaxies from a catalog describing the training
    sample.

      - The number of images in the cube matches the number of rows in the catalog.
      - Each image size is computed automatically by GalSim based on the Nyquist size.
      - Both galaxies and stars.
      - PSF is a double Gaussian, the same for each galaxy.
      - Galaxies are randomly rotated to remove the imprint of any lensing shears in the COSMOS
        data.
      - The same shear is applied to each galaxy.
      - Noise is Poisson using a nominal sky value of 1.e6 ADU/arcsec^2,
        the noise in the original COSMOS data.
