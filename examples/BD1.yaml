# YAML configuration file for use with the executable galsim_yaml
# Type:
#   galsim_yaml BD1.yaml
#
# This configuration file is designed to be equivalent to the example script called
# Script1 in BasicDemo.py.
# It's pretty close to the minimal configuration file that you might want to use.
#

# The gal field defines what kind of galaxy profile to use.
gal :
    # One of the simplest profiles is a Gaussian.
    type : Gaussian

    # Gaussian profiles have a number of possible size parameters, but
    # sigma is the most basic one.  
    # The others are fwhm and half_light_radius.  At least one of these must be specified.
    sigma : 2.  # arcsec

    # The default flux would be 1, but you would typically want to define the flux 
    # to be something other than that.
    flux : 1.e5  # ADU
 

# Technically, psf isn't required, but for astronomical images, we always have a psf,
# so you'll usually want to define one.  (If it's omitted, the galaxy isn't convolved 
# by anything, so effectively a delta function psf.)
# We use a Gaussian again for simplicity, but one somewhat smaller than the galaxy.
psf : 
    type : Gaussian
    sigma : 1.0   # arcsec
    # No need to specify a flux, since flux=1 is the right thing for a psf.


# The image field specifies some other information about the image to be drawn.
image :
    # If pixel_scale isn't specified, then pixel_scale = 1 is assumed.
    pixel_scale : 0.2   # arcsec / pixel

    # If you want noise in the image (which is typical) you specify that here.
    # In this case we use gaussian noise.
    noise : 
        type : Gaussian
        sigma : 300.   # ADU / pixel

    # You can also specify the size of the image if you want, but if you omit it
    # (as we do here), then GalSim will automatically size the image appropriately.


# Typically, you will want to specify the output format and file name.
# If this is omitted, the output will be to a fits file with the same root name as the 
# config file (so BD1.fits in this case), but that's usually not a great choice.
# So at the very least, you would typically want to specify at least the file_name.
output :
    dir : output_yaml
    file_name : demo1.fits
