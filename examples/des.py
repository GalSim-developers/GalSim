Draw DES PSFs at the locations of observed galaxies.

This demo probably isn't so useful as an actual program, but it does showcase how to
use the DES module that comes with GalSim, which can be modified to do what you actually
need.

It works on a full DES exposure with 62 chip images and the files that are output by the
DESDM and WL pipelines.  We don't include these files in the repo, since they total about
700 MB.  You can download a tarball with the files used by this script at

    http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~mjarvis/des_data.html

The DESDM pipeline produces a catalog of detected objects for each image, and also an
interpolated PSF using Emmanuel Bertin's PSFEx code, which are stored in *_psfcat.psf files.
The WL pipeline produces a different estimate of the PSF using Mike Jarvis's shapelet code,
which are stored in *_fitpsf.fits files.

This script reads the appropriate files for each chip and builds two images, one for each kind
of PSF estimate, and draws an image of the PSF at the location of each galaxy.  Normally, you
would probably want to draw these with no noise on individual postage stamps or something like
that.
