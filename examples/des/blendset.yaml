# A simulation of blended pairs of galaxies at various separations and flux ratios.
# There are two parallel runs, one normal and the other where the neighbor only contributes
# to the noise, not the flux.  So this simulates a perfect deblender that removes the flux
# correctly, but there is still the extra noise from the neighbor.

modules:
    # Use the extra features from the galsim.des module
    - galsim.des

    # A module in this directory that defines some custom types related to blending
    - blend

    # A module that defines the LogNormal distribution.

stamp:
    # In blend.py (loaded by the modules field above), we define a custom stamp type
    # called Blend.
    # It has one galaxy centered (more or less -- cf image.offset) on the stamp, and then
    # some number of neighbors also appearing on the stamp placed randomly within some range
    # of allowed separations.
    type: BlendSet

    # Up to 5 neighbors.  Each neighbor has a prob of p=0.3 of being included.
    n_neighbors:
        type: RandomBinomial

    # The neighbors cannot be too close (assume they are rejected as unusable) or too far
    # (not really a blend).
    min_sep: 2   # arcsec -- clearly overlapping.  Too hard to deblend.
    max_sep: 10  # arcsec -- this would be off the edge of the stamp.  Not really blended.

    # Offset is just random within central pixel.
