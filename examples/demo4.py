Demo #4

The fourth script in our tutorial about using GalSim in python scripts: examples/demo*.py.
(This file is designed to be viewed in a window 100 characters wide.)

This script is our first one to create multiple images.  Typically, you would want each object
to have at least some of its attributes vary when you are drawing multiple images (although 
not necessarily -- you might just want different noise realization of the same profile).  
The easiest way to do this is to read in the properties from a catalog, which is what we
do in this script.  The PSF is a truncated Moffat profile, and the galaxy is bulge plus disk.
Both components get many of their parameters from an input catalog.  We also shift the 
profile by a fraction of a pixel in each direction so the effect of pixelization varies
among the images.  Each galaxy has the same applied shear.  The noise is simple Poisson noise.
We write the images out into a multi-extension fits file.

New features introduced in this demo:

- cat = galsim.Catalog(file_name, dir)
- obj = galsim.Moffat(beta, fwhm, trunc)
- obj = galsim.Add([list of objects])
- obj.setFlux(flux)
- galsim.fits.writeMulti([list of images], file_name)

    Make a fits image cube using parameters from an input catalog
      - The number of images in the cube matches the number of rows in the catalog.
      - Each image size is computed automatically by GalSim based on the Nyquist size.
      - Only galaxies.  No stars.
      - PSF is Moffat
      - Each galaxy is bulge plus disk: deVaucouleurs + Exponential.
      - The catalog's columns are:
         0 PSF beta (Moffat exponent)
         1 PSF FWHM
         2 PSF e1
         3 PSF e2
         4 PSF trunc
         5 Disc half-light-radius

         7 Disc e2
         8 Bulge half-light-radius
         9 Bulge e1
        10 Bulge e2
        11 Galaxy dx (the two components have same center)
        12 Galaxy dy
      - Applied shear is the same for each galaxy
      - Noise is Poisson using a nominal sky value of 1.e6
