"""
Make a FITS file of a surface brightness pattern using photon shooting
Usage:  SBDraw <sb_string> <fitsname> <dx> <dim> <nPhotons>
sb_string is parsed to define the pattern, enclose in quotes on cmd line
fitsname  is name of output FITS file
dx is pixel scale for output image
dim is number of pixels per side for FITS image
nPhotons is number of photons to shoot through the image
