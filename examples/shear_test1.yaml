# This is a GalSim configuration file.  To run it, (using galsim v0.2 or later) do
#
#     galsim shear_test1.yaml
#
# It builds 15 files of galaxy images with tiled postage stamps where all the galaxies have the
# same applied shear: (0.03, 0.02).
#
# All files have 1024 galaxies (32 x 32 tiled postage stamps) drawn at a signal-to-noise of 1000.
# The pixel scale is 0.27 arcsec/pixel, and the PSF is Kolmogorov with fwhm = 0.8 arcsec.
# The galaxy orientations are done in rings of 16 with the first orientation in each ring random.
#
# Different directories correspond to different galaxy profiles.
#
#     profile01   Gaussian
#     profile02   Exponential
#     profile03   DeVaucouleurs
#     profile04   Concentric Bulge + Disk
#     profile05   Orthogonal Bulge + Disk (each has e=0.2 in orthogonal directions)
#     profile06   Off-center Bulge + Disk (also a relative shift of 0.2 arcsec in random dir)
#
# Within each directory, there are 3 different ellipticities and  5 different resolutions.
# For the Bulge+Disk profiles, the overall ellipticity is applied in a random direction
# relative to the Bulge and Disk ellipticities.  Also, note that the final "ellipticity"
# in those cases won't necessarily match the given number, depending on the weighting used.
# Also, the half-light radius won't be quite correct for those either, but it should be close.
#
# The file names look like:
#
#     ellip00hlr05.fits  for e = 0.0, half-light radius = 0.5
#
#     ellip values are 00, 03, 06 for e = 0.0, 0.3 and 0.6.
#     hlr values are 04, 08, 12, 16, 20 for half-light radius = 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6 and 2.0.
#
# In addition to this, each directory also has a file with PSF images, called psf.fits.


# Some variables that you might want to change.  These will be used below:
# Parameters below that use Eval can use these variable names (less the first letter, which
# defines what type the variable is).  We also tag them as YAML-style variables, so we can
# use them in that way as well.
