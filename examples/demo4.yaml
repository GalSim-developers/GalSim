# Demo #4
#
# The fourth YAML configuration file in our tutorial about using Galsim config files
# (This file is designed to be viewed in a window 100 characters wide.)
#
# This script is our first one to create multiple images.  Typically, you would want each
# object to have at least some of its attributes vary when you are drawing multiple images 
# (although not necessarily -- you might just want different noise realization of the same 
# profile).  The easiest way to do this is to read in the properties from a catalog, which is 
# what we do in this script.  The PSF is a truncated Moffat profile, and the galaxy is bulge
# plus disk.  Both components get many of their parameters from an input catalog.  We also
# shift the profile by a fraction of a pixel in each direction so the effect of pixelization 
# varies among the images.  Each galaxy has the same applied shear.  The noise is simple 
# Poisson noise.  We write the images out into a multi-extension fits file.
#
# New features introduced in this demo:
#
# - obj type : Moffat (..., trunc)
# - obj type : DeVaucouleurs (flux, half_light_radius)
# - value type : Catalog (col)
# - shift type : XY (x, y)
# - shear type : E1E2 (e1, e2)
# - image : xsize, ysize
# - top level field input
# - input : catalog (file_name, dir)
# - output type : MultiFits (file_name, dir)
#
# - Using both ellip and shear for the same object
# - Using variables in a YAML file
 

# You can define variables to be used later using the & symbol here.
# Later they will be used with the * symbol.
# This can be useful since you can put things you want to change often near the top of the 
# file so you don't have to scroll down to find the right place to edit something each time 
# you want to change it.
