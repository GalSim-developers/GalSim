# The fourth YAML configuration file in our tutorial about using Galsim config files
# (This file is designed to be viewed in a window 100 characters wide.)
#
# This script is our first one to create multiple images.  Typically, you would
# want each object to have at least some of its attributes vary when you are
# drawing multiple images (although not necessarily -- you might just want
# different noise realization of the same profile).  The easiest way to do this
# is to read in the properties from a catalog, which is what we do in this
# script.  The PSF is a truncated Moffat profile, and the galaxy is bulge plus
# disk, with added knots of star formation.  Both components get many of their
# parameters from an input catalog.  We also shift the profile by a fraction of
# a pixel in each direction so the effect of pixelization varies among the
# images.  Each galaxy has the same applied shear.  The noise is simple Poisson
# noise.  We write the images out into a multi-extension fits file.
#
# New features introduced in this demo:
#
# - obj type : Moffat (..., trunc)
# - obj type : DeVaucouleurs (flux, half_light_radius)
# - obj type : RandomWalk (npoints, half_light_radius, flux)
# - value type : Catalog (col)
# - obj : shift
# - shift type : XY (x, y)
# - shear type : E1E2 (e1, e2)
# - image : xsize, ysize
# - top level field input
# - input : catalog (file_name, dir)
# - output type : MultiFits (file_name, dir)
#
# - Using both ellip and shear for the same object
# - Using variables in a YAML file
 

# You can define variables to be used later using the & symbol here.
# Later they will be used with the * symbol.
# This can be useful since you can put things you want to change often near the top of the 
# file so you don't have to scroll down to find the right place to edit something each time 
# you want to change it.

    # An object may have an ellip and a shear, each of which can be specified in any format:
    #   - E1E2 or EBeta (distortion)
    #   - G1G2 or GBeta (reduced shear)
    #   - Eta1Eta2 or EtaBeta (conformal shear, cf. demo9)
    #   - QBeta (axis ratio, cf. demo3)
    # Furthermore, the shear operations do not commute, so it matters which one is applied first.
    # We use ellip to mean the intrinsic shape of the object and shear to mean the shear that
    # is applied by lensing or other sources.  These also don't commute with either rotations or
    # shifts, so here is the full list of transformations in the order that they are applied:
    #
    # - dilate or dilation        = scale linear size of the object preserving flux
    # - ellip                     = set the intrinsic shape of the object
    # - rotate or rotation        = rotate by some angle
    # - magnify or magnification  = scale linear size of object preserving surface brightness
    # - shear                     = apply the gravitational shear
    # - shift                     = shift the centroid of the object
