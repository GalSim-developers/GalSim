# The Great3 real-ground-constant branch configuration file
# Note: This configuration will not produce images _identical_ to the ones used for Great3,
# since the order of random number generation is different.  However, it is intended to
# produce an _equivalent_ simulation as the one produced for Great3.

# The real-galaxy branch is almost identical to the control branch.  So rather than duplicate
# everything from cgc_psf.yaml and change one item, we use the template feature of GalSim config.

# This copies over everything from cgc_psf.yaml
template : cgc_psf.yaml

# Change the output directory
output.dir : real/ground/constant
