# An alterate version of the Great3 control-ground-constant branch configuration file,
# using an I<25.2 sample (instead of faking a deeper sample using I<23.5 images).

# Start with the cgc.yaml file, which we'll modify below.
template: cgc.yaml

# No need to dilate now, since we have the right size distribution.
# Giving an empty string as a value means to remove an item from the dict.
# Here, we could also have just given the value 1.0, which is equivalent.

# Note that in cgc.yaml, this equation had an 0.004 out in front, and was set up such that if
# you had a particular flux value in the catalog, you would get the right range of S/N for
# the galaxies while using this variance.  When using the I<25.2 catalog, we are not trying
# to mimic a deeper sample (we HAVE a deeper sample) and so we reduce the noise variance
# by a factor corresponding to the square of the flux ratio at the limiting magnitude.
