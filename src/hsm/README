********************Note about this README********************

This README was distributed with the meas_shape package that is the
original source of the PSFCorr.cpp code.  However, the code has been
substantially modified once it was incorporated into GalSim, such that
details in this README about usage are very outdated.  The rest of the
README is preserved below for the sake of historical accuracy, and can
still be used to e.g. find references to papers that describe the
algorithms in more detail but not to learn how to use the code.

******************Warranty**************************************

Two of the PSF correction techniques that are performed by this code
has been tested very extensively (linear and re-Gaussianization), and
one of those was used for numerous science applications
(re-Gaussianization), as will be described in more detail below.
Several other techniques are provided and were tested in some detail
but not used for science.  Consequently while they can be shown to
give reasonable results on the test cases, we cannot promise
science-quality outputs for these methods.  Before using the other
techniques for science, we recommend extensive testing.

******************Package dependencies**************************

This package relies on the cfitsio package to read FITS images into C
code.  It also utilizes several of the Numerical Recipes routines that
are in the public domain such as dvector, dmatrix, etc. (code provided
with the package and modified as needed).

******************Purpose***************************************

The purpose of this code is to perform PSF correction to measure
galaxy shapes for the purpose of weak lensing.  The code can do
several methods of PSF correction, described and tested on simulated
data in Hirata & Seljak (2003),
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003MNRAS.343..459H.

The PSF correction methods are specified on the command line:

  (a) KSB: an implementation of the method from Kaiser, Squires,
      & Broadhurst (1995) described in
      http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995ApJ...449..460K.  This method
      is specified using KSB for the shear estimator.

  (b) Bernstein & Jarvis (2002), appendix C: Method to apply a
      rounding kernel, and then correct the galaxy image moments using an
      equation that is valid in the limit that the galaxy and PSF are
      approximately Gaussian.  This method is specified using BJ for
      the shear estimator.

  (c) Linear: a variation of method (b) described in Appendix B of
      Hirata & Seljak (2003).  This method accounts for the first
      order departure of both the galaxy and PSF from Gaussianity, and
      is specified using LINEAR for the shear estimator.

  (d) Re-Gaussianization: Method described in section 2.4 of Hirata &
      Seljak (2003) that includes a correction for the full departure of the
      PSF from Gaussianity.  Note that this method has been tested more
      extensively in, e.g., 
	http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005MNRAS.361.1287M
	http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007MNRAS.376...13M
      for ground-based data only.  This method is specified using
      REGAUSS for the shear estimator.

  (e) Shapelets: an implementation of the method from Refregier
      (2003).  This method is specified using SHAPELET plus two numbers
      specifying the order of expansion for the PSF and galaxy,
      respectively.  For example, an 8th order expansion for both would be
      specified using SHAPELET8,8.

The shapes are defined using e = (1-q^2)/(1+q^2) for an axis ratio
0<=q<=1. We also have a routine meas_moments.c that can be used to
simply determine the adaptive moments of a galaxy image.

******************Inputs****************************************

The meas_shape.c code requires the specification of several pieces of information
on the command line:

  (a) A FITS image file containing the observed galaxy image.

  (b) A FITS image file containing the image of the PSF at the
      position of the galaxy (where the PSF is assumed to be approximately
      centered in the postage stamp). 

  (c, d) Guess for the centroid of the galaxy relative to the lower
	 left corner of the galaxy postage stamp.  Note that this means the
	 galaxy does not have to be centered within the postage stamp for the
	 code to work.  Furthermore, only a rough guess is needed, because the
	 centroid is recalculated in the process of estimating the adaptive
	 moments.  

  (e) Sky variance (counts^2/pixel) in the galaxy image.  Currently the code
      does not support the input of a variable sky variance map.

  (f) Code for which shear estimator to use, as described above.

  (g) Sky level in the galaxy and PSF images (e.g., SDSS images such
  as in examples/ contain a "soft bias" of 1000 counts per pixel,
  whereas sbprofile outputs contain sky=0).

For meas_moments.c, the code requires the image file and a guess at
the size in pixels.

******************Hard-coded numbers**********************************

There are several numbers that are currently hard-coded in
meas_shape.c that may need to be changed depending on the situation:

  (a) In meas_shape.c, ARCSEC: the number of pixels per arcsec, currently hard-coded to
      the value for SDSS.  This number is only used to provide initial
      (very rough) guesses for the galaxy and PSF sizes (2.5" and 1") - the
      code itself works with pixels as the standard length scale.

  (b) In meas_moments.c, FLUX_OFFSET: a number that is subtracted from all galaxy postage
      stamps and PSF images. 

  (c) MPIX: maximum allowable number of pixels in the images.


******************Outputs**********************************

The output of the shape measurement code is a single line containing
the following 9 numbers:
  (a) Status of the measurement (hex). 
  (b) PSF-corrected e_1 in image coordinates.
  (c) PSF-corrected e_2 in image coordinates.
  (d) Measurement type: shear or ellipticity.
  (e) Responsivity, currently set to 1 for all methods.  For those
methods with shear responsivity not equal to one, this number should
be determined for the entire galaxy ensemble from the data.
  (f) Resolution factor, which is 0 for a PSF and 1 for cases where
the PSF size is negligible compared to the galaxy size.
  (g) Measurement error on the *shear*.  Note that if the measurement
type is ellipticity, then to get an ellipticity error, this number
must be multiplied by 2.
  (h) A crude size estimate from the adaptive moments.
  (i) A crude flux (counts) estimate.

The meaning of the outputs depends on the particular PSF correction
scheme.  In some cases, the output numbers are ellipticities that have
to be converted to shear estimates.  In other cases (KSB and
shapelets), the output numbers are shears.  The type of measurement
that is being returned is indicated in the output as "measurement
type," and should be handled appropriately before being used for weak
lensing - for example, division by shear responsivities,
etc. depending on the particular method. 

Other operations that typically must be done to the output: rotation
to an overall coordinate system (e.g. RA/dec); correction for camera
shear; application of cuts on the resolution factor to remove those
galaxies that are too small to resolve well.

The output of the moments code is a single line containing the
following 10 numbers:
  (a) status (should be zero for success)
  (b-d) Mxx, Myy, Mxy
  (e,f) e_1, e_2
  (g) number of iterations
  (h) 4th moment
  (i, j) adaptive centroid
  

******************Errors and failures**********************************

In the case of some error in the shape measurement, the status flag
will be nonzero and the ellipticities and resolution factors returned
by the code will be precisely zero.  

Note that this code has been optimized towards SDSS data, and on this
dataset, a typical field with ~180 useful galaxies will have
successful measurements for ~178 of them.  The failures can occur for
many reasons, such as failure of adaptive moments to converge.
Additional optimization or changes in convergence criteria may be
necessary for other datasets with very different noise properties or
seeing.  However, the behavior on the (very different) STEP2 simulations
was found to be reasonable, with a similar failure rate, so we do not
envision significant difficulties in adapting the code for other
datasets. 


******************Examples**********************************

As test cases, we have included in the examples/ directory the
necessary information for five galaxies in SDSS: galaxy images, PSF
images, and image information.  Our outputs for each of the shape
measurement methods is given in that directory, in files named
example.$method.out for $method = bj, ksb, linear, regauss, and
shapelet8 (where the last is 8th order shapelets).  In order to
generate comparable output, run the commands in the included file
EXAMPLES, which will create files myexample.$method.out. 


******************Masking**********************************

The code has one additional capability that is not used in the current
distribution: masking images.  The SDSS atlas images do not include
separate masks (instead, masking is done by setting the pixel values
to zero), and thus the routine to read in the images in meas_shape.c
does not read in a mask.  However, the structures containing the
images also have an array allocated for the mask, and computations on
the images check this mask array to ensure that only unmasked pixels
are used.  For datasets in which masking is needed, it is therefore
only necessary to change the file readin section of meas_shape.c to
read in the mask as well.
